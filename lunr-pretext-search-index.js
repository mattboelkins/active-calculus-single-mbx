  "body": " This text began as my sabbatical project in the winter semester of 2012, during which I wrote most of the material for the first four chapters. For the sabbatical leave, I am indebted to Grand Valley State University for its support of the project, as well as to my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for their endorsement of the project. I'm also grateful to the American Institute of Mathematics for their support of free and open textbooks in general , and their support of this one in particular.  The beautiful full-color .eps graphics in the text are only possible because of David Austin of GVSU and Bill Casselman of the University of British Columbia. Building on their longstanding efforts to develop tools for high quality mathematical graphics, David wrote a library of Python routines that employ Bill's PiScript program ; David's routines are so easy to use that even I could generate graphics like the professionals that he and Bill are. I am deeply grateful to them both.  The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of the original Mathbook XML, now known as PreTeXt . My ability to take advantage of Rob's work is due in large part to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics, which funded me to attend a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, in April 2016, as well as the support of the ongoing user group . A subsequent workshop in June 2019 has offered further support and more improvements to the text.  David Farmer's conversion script saved me hundreds of hours of work by taking my original latex source and converting it to PreTeXt ; David remains a major source of ongoing support and advocacy. Alex Jordan of Portland Community College has also been a tremendous help, and it is through Alex's fantastic work that live WeBWorK exercises are not only possible, but also included from the 2017 version forward. Mitch Keller of Morningside College agreed in early 2018 to serve as the book's production editor; his technical expertise has contributed to many aspects of the book, including the presence of answers to activities and non- WeBWorK exercises and other supporting material for instructors.  For the 2018 edition, Kathy Yoshiwara of the AIM Editorial Board read the entire text and contributed editorial suggestions for every section. In short, she made the prose cleaner, more direct, and simply better. I'm deeply thankful for her time, effort, and insights.  Over my more than 20 years at GVSU, many of my colleagues have shared with me ideas and resources for teaching calculus. I am particularly indebted to David Austin, Will Dickinson, Paul Fishback, Jon Hodge, and Steve Schlicker for their contributions that improved my teaching of and thinking about calculus, including materials that I have modified and used over many different semesters with students. Parts of these ideas can be found throughout this text. In addition, Will Dickinson and Steve Schlicker provided me access to a large number of their electronic notes and activities from teaching of differential and integral calculus, and those ideas and materials have similarly impacted my work and writing in positive ways, with some of their problems and approaches finding parallel presentation here.  In the summer of 2012, David and Steve each agreed to write a chapter to support the completion of the material on integral calculus. David is the lead author of Chapter and Steve the lead author of Chapter . Along with our colleague Ted Sundstrom, Steve has also contributed a large number of problem and activity solutions and answers. I'm especially grateful for how the work of these friends and colleagues has made the text so much better.  Shelly Smith of GVSU and Matt DeLong of Marian University both provided extensive comments on the first few chapters of early drafts, feedback that was immensely helpful in improving the text. As more and more people use the text, I am grateful to everyone who reads, edits, and uses this book, and hence contributes to its improvement through ongoing discussion.  Finally, I am grateful for all that my students have taught me over the years. Their responses and feedback have helped to shape me as a teacher, and I appreciate their willingness to wholeheartedly engage in the activities and approaches I've tried in class, to let me know how those affect their learning, and to help me learn and grow as an instructor. Early on, they also provided useful editorial feedback on this text.  Any and all remaining errors or inconsistencies are mine. I will gladly take reader and user feedback to correct them, along with other suggestions to improve the text.   "

  "title": "Active Calculus: Our Goals",
  "body": " Active Calculus: Our Goals  Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.  While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas they present are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance. In the 21st century and the age of the internet, no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a primary purpose of this work is to present a calculus text that is free . See https:\/\/activecalculus.org for links to both the .html and .pdf versions of the text. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source . See GitHub for the source. Since August 2013, Active Calculus - Single Variable has been endorsed by the American Institute of Mathematics and its Open Textbook Initiative .  In Active Calculus - Single Variable , we actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are generated by students. Where many texts present a general theory followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand calculus for themselves. This approach is consistent with the scholarly consensus that calls for students to be interactively engaged in class.  Moreover, this approach is consistent with the following goals:   To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners construct solutions and approaches to ideas, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.    To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in calculus are natural and true. Often we do this through consideration of the instantaneous position and velocity of a moving object.    To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, working on activities in small groups in class, and doing substantial exercises outside of class time.    To strengthen students' written and oral communicating skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of calculus.     "

  "title": "Features of the Text",
  "body": " Features of the Text  Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:   Motivating Questions  At the start of each section, we list 2 3 motivating questions that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One overall goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.    Preview Activities  Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by a preview activity . This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students in advance of class, and to be completed by students before the day on which a particular section is to be considered.    Activities  A typical section in the text has at least three activities . These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working individually or in small groups.    Exercises  There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the Open Problem Library and around 20,000 calculus problems. In this text, each section includes a small number of anonymous WeBWorK exercises, as well as 3 4 challenging problems per section. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in the .html version of the text , as this provides students with immediate feedback without penalty. Almost every non- WeBWorK exercise has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available APEX Calculus text by Greg Hartmann et al., available from www.apexcalculus.com .    Graphics  We strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color To keep cost low, the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.    Links to interactive graphics  Many of the ideas of calculus are best understood dynamically; java applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations. Relying primarily on the work of David Austin of Grand Valley State University and Marc Renault of Shippensburg University, each of whom has developed a large library of applets for calculus, we frequently point the reader (through active links in the electronic versions of the text) to applets that are relevant for key ideas under consideration.    Summary of Key Ideas  Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.

  "body": " Students! Read this!  This book is different.  The text is available in three different formats: HTML, PDF, and print, each of which is available via links on the landing page at activecalculus.org\/ . The first two formats are free. If you are going to use the book electronically, the best mode is the HTML . The HTML version looks great in any browser, including on a smartphone, and the links are much easier to navigate in HTML than in PDF. Some particular direct suggestions about using the HTML follow among the next few paragraphs; alternatively, you can watch this short video from the author . It is also wise to download and save the PDF, since you can use the PDF offline, while the HTML version requires an internet connection. A print copy costs about $21 via Amazon .  This book is intended to be read sequentially and engaged with, much more than to be used as a lookup reference. For example, each section begins with a short introduction and a Preview Activity; you should read the short introduction and complete the Preview Activity prior to class. Your instructor may require you to do this. Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes and are intended to be accessible based on the understanding you have from preceding sections. There are not answers provided to Preview Activities, as these are designed simply to get you thinking about ideas that will be helpful in work on upcoming new material.  As you use the book, think of it as a workbook, not a worked-book. There is a great deal of scholarship that shows people learn better when they interactively engage and struggle with ideas themselves, rather than passively watch others. Thus, instead of reading worked examples or watching an instructor complete examples, you will engage with Activities that prompt you to grapple with concepts and develop deep understanding. You should expect to spend time in class working with peers on Activities and getting feedback from them and from your instructor. You can purchase a separate Activities Workbook from Amazon ( Chapters 1-4 , Chapters 5-8 ) in which to record your work on the activities, or you can ask your instructor for a copy of the PDF file that has only the activities along with room to record your work. Your goal should be to do all of the activities in the relevant sections of the text and keep a careful record of your work. You can find answers to the activities in the back matter .  Each section concludes with a Summary. Reading the Summary after you have read the section and worked the Activities is a good way to find a short list of key ideas that are most essential to take from the section. A good study habit is to write similar summaries in your own words.  At the end of each section, you'll find two types of Exercises. First, there are several anonymous WeBWorK exercises. These are online, interactive exercises that allow you to submit answers for immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty; to submit answers, you have to be using the HTML version of the text (see this short video on the HTML version that includes a WeBWorK demonstration). You should use these exercises as a way to test your understanding of basic ideas in the preceding section. If your institution uses WeBWorK , you may also need to log in to a server as directed by your instructor to complete assigned WeBWorK sets as part of your course grade. The WeBWorK exercises included in this text are ungraded and not connected to any individual account. Following the WeBWorK exercises there are 3-4 additional challenging exercises that are designed to encourage you to connect ideas, investigate new situations, and write about your understanding. There are answers to most of the non- WeBWorK exercises in the back matter .  You can find additional support for your work in learning calculus from the GVSU Math 201 YouTube Channel and GVSU Math 202 YouTube Channel where there are several short video tutorials for each section of the text, numbered in alignment with the textbook sections. Math 201 corresponds to Chapters 1-4 and Math 202 to Chapters 5-8; there are about 90 videos for each, totaling more than 180.  The best way to be successful in mathematics generally and calculus specifically is to strive to make sense of the main ideas. We make sense of ideas by asking questions, interacting with others, attempting to solve problems, making mistakes, revising attempts, and writing and speaking about our understanding. This text has been designed to help you make sense of calculus; we wish you the very best as you undertake the large and challenging task of doing so.  "

  "title": "Instructors!  Read this!",
  "body": " Instructors! Read this!  This book is different. Before you read further, first read Students! Read this! .  Chapters 1-4 are designed to correspond to what is often called differential calculus. Chapters 5-8 correspond roughly to what is often called integral calculus, including chapters on differential equations and infinite series.  Among the three formats (HTML, PDF, print), the HTML is optimal for display in class if you have a suitable projector. The HTML is also best for navigation, as links to internal and external references are much more obvious. We recommend saving a downloaded version of the PDF format as a backup in the event you don't have internet access. It's a good idea for each student to have a printed version of the Activities Workbook, which is available on Amazon ( Chapters 1-4 , Chapters 5-8 ) or as a PDF document by direct request to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu); many instructors use the PDF to have coursepacks printed for students to purchase from their local bookstore.  The text is written so that, on average, one section corresponds to two hours of class meeting time. A typical instructional sequence when starting a new section might look like the following:   Students complete a Preview Activity in advance of class. Class begins with a short debrief among peers followed by all class discussion. (5-10 minutes)    Brief lecture and discussion to build on the preview activity and set the stage for the next activity. (5-10 minutes)     Students engage with peers to work on and discuss the first activity in the section. (15-20 minutes)     Brief discussion and possibly lecture to reach closure on the preceding activity, followed by transition to new ideas. (Varies, but 5-15 minutes)    Possibly begin next activity.   The next hour of class would be similar, but without the Preview Activity to complete prior to class: the principal focus of class will be completing 2 activities. Then rinse and repeat.  We recommend that instructors use appropriate incentives to encourage students to complete Preview Activities prior to class. Having these be part of completion-based assignments that count 5% of the semester grade usually results in the vast majority of students completing the vast majority of the previews. If you'd like to see a sample syllabus for how to organize a course and weight various assignments, you can request one via email to the author.  Note that the WeBWorK exercises in the HTML version are anonymous and there's not a way to track students' engagement with them. These are intended to be formative for students and provide them with immediate feedback without penalty. If your institution is a WeBWorK user, we have existing sets of .def files that correspond to the sections in the text; these are available upon request to the author.  In the back matter of the text, you'll find answers to the Activities and to non- WeBWorK Exercises . Instructors interested in solutions to these should contact the author directly.  You and your students can find additional resources in the GVSU Math 201 YouTube Channel and GVSU Math 202 YouTube Channel where there are short video tutorials for every section of the text. Math 201 (GVSU's Calculus I) corresponds to Chapters 1-4 and Math 202 (GVSU's Calculus II) to Chapters 5-8.  The PreTeXt source code for the text can be found on GitHub . If you find errors in the text or have other suggestions, you can file an issue on GitHub, use the Feedback link in the HTML version (found at the bottom left in the main menu), or email the author directly. To engage with instructors who use the text, we maintain both an email list and the Open Calculus blog ; you can request that your address be added to the email list by contacting the author. Finally, if you're interested in a video presentation on using the text, you can see this online video presentation to the MIT Electronic Seminar on Mathematics Education ; at about the 17-minute mark, the portion begins where we demonstrate features of and how to use the text.  Thank you for considering Active Calculus as a resource to help your students develop deep understanding of the subject. I wish you the very best in your work and hope to hear from you.  "

  "title": "How do we measure velocity?",
  "body": " How do we measure velocity?     How is the average velocity of a moving object connected to the values of its position function?    How do we interpret the average velocity of an object geometrically on the graph of its position function?    How is the notion of instantaneous velocity connected to average velocity?      Calculus can be viewed broadly as the study of change. A natural and important question to ask about any changing quantity is how fast is the quantity changing?   We begin with a simple problem: a ball is tossed straight up in the air. How is the ball moving? Questions like this one are central to our study of differential calculus.        Position and average velocity  Any moving object has a position  position that can be considered a function of time . When the motion is along a straight line, the position is given by a single variable, which we denote by . For example, might give the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time in hours. Similarly, the function described in Preview Activity is a position function, where position is measured vertically relative to the ground.  On any time interval, a moving object also has an average velocity . For example, to compute a car's average velocity we divide the number of miles traveled by the time elapsed, which gives the velocity in miles per hour . Similarly, the value of in Preview Activity gave the average velocity of the ball on the time interval , measured in feet per second.  In general, we make the following definition:   Average Velocity  For an object moving in a straight line with position function , the average velocity  average velocity of the object on the interval from to , denoted , is given by the formula .   Note well: the units on are units of per unit of , such as miles per hour or feet per second.     The following questions concern the position function given by , considered in Preview Activity .     Compute the average velocity of the ball on each of the following time intervals: , , , , , , , . Include units for each value.    On the graph provided in Figure , sketch the line that passes through the points and . What is the meaning of the slope of this line? In light of this meaning, what is a geometric way to interpret each of the values computed in the preceding question?    Use a graphing utility to plot the graph of on an interval containing the value . Then, zoom in repeatedly on the point . What do you observe about how the graph appears as you view it more and more closely?    What do you conjecture is the velocity of the ball at the instant ? Why?      A partial plot of .         On , the average velocity is ft\/sec.    Remember that the slope of a line can be found by taking rise over run. In this context, the slope is found by computing change in over change in .     While the curve is a parabola, how does it look up close on a very small interval?     Instantaneous velocity can be approximated by average velocity on a very small interval.           ft\/sec; ft\/sec; the other average velocities are, respectively, 6.56, 6.416, 0, 4.8, 6.24, 6.384, all in ft\/sec.     is the average velocity of the ball between and .       Like a straight line with slope about 6.4.    About 6.4 feet per second.          On , the average velocity is ft\/sec. On , the average velocity is 8 ft\/sec. The other average velocities are, respectively (in the order of the intervals listed in the activity), 6.56, 6.416, 0, 4.8, 6.24, 6.384, all measured in feet per second.    The slope of the line between and is . This is precisely the average velocity of the ball between and , and indeed each of the average velocities computed in (a) can be viewed as the slope of the line joining the points and .       As we zoom in on the curve at the point , the graph begins to look like a straight line. Indeed, it appears to look like a straight line with slope about 6.4.    Observe that the average velocity of the ball on the intervals and is 6.416 and 6.384 feet\/sec respectively. Hence it appears that the ball's velocity at the instant should be about 6.4 feet per second.         Instantaneous Velocity  Whether we are driving a car, riding a bike, or throwing a ball, we have an intuitive sense that a moving object has a velocity at any given moment -- a number that measures how fast the object is moving right now . For instance, a car's speedometer tells the driver the car's velocity at any given instant. In fact, the velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval. If we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter, we can progress from average velocity to instantaneous velocity.  Informally, we define the instantaneous velocity  instantaneous velocity of a moving object at time to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing . We will develop a more formal definition of instantaneous velocity soon, and this definition will be the foundation of much of our work in calculus. For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity as follows: take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals around a specific point. If those average velocities approach a single number, then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.    Each of the following questions concern , the position function from Preview Activity .     Compute the average velocity of the ball on the time interval . What is different between this value and the average velocity on the interval ?    Use appropriate computing technology to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the ball at . Likewise, estimate the instantaneous velocity of the ball at . Which value is greater?    How is the sign of the instantaneous velocity of the ball related to its behavior at a given point in time? That is, what does positive instantaneous velocity tell you the ball is doing? Negative instantaneous velocity?    Without doing any computations, what do you expect to be the instantaneous velocity of the ball at ? Why?          Remember to use the formula for average velocity from above: . Think carefully about whether certain quantities are positive or negative.    To estimate the instantaneous velocity at , consider average velocities on the intervals and .    Think about whether the ball is rising or falling.    What is the average velocity of the ball on small intervals that contain ?           ft\/sec, which is negative.    The instantaneous velocity at is approximately ft\/sec; at , the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec, and .    When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.    Zero.           ft\/sec. We note that this average velocity is negative, and in fact is the opposite of the average velocity of 24 ft\/sec on the interval .    Since and , it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at is approximately ft\/sec. Similar computations show that at , it appears the instantaneous velocity is about ft\/sec. Note that , so the instantaneous velocity at is greater because it is less negative. Asking which number is greater is different from asking which number is more negative.     When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.    Note that is the vertex of the parabola given by . At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling. On intervals of the form , where , the average velocity of the ball is positive; on intervals of form , where , the average velocity is positive. Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment to be zero.        At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity. Each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function. We are interested in computing average velocities on the interval for smaller and smaller intervals. In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal, think of the value as , where is a small (non-zero) number that is allowed to vary. Then the average velocity of the object on the interval is , with the denominator being simply because . Note that when , measures the average velocity on the interval .  To find the instantaneous velocity at , we investigate what happens as the value of approaches zero.   Computing instantaneous velocity for a falling ball   The position function for a falling ball is given by (where is measured in feet and in seconds).    Find an expression for the average velocity of the ball on a time interval of the form where and .  Use this expression to compute the average velocity on and .  Make a conjecture about the instantaneous velocity at .        We make the assumptions that and because cannot be zero (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity) and because the function only makes sense on the time interval , as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling. We want to compute and simplify . We start by finding . To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function . . Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity, we find that . At this point, we note two things: first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on , which it must, since as changes the average velocity will change. Further, we note that since can never equal zero, we may remove the common factor of from the numerator and denominator. It follows that .  From this expression we can compute the average for any small positive or negative value of . For instance, to obtain the average velocity on , we let , and the average velocity is ft\/sec. To get the average velocity on , we let , and compute the average velocity as .  We can even explore what happens to as gets closer and closer to zero. As approaches zero, will also approach zero, so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at should be ft\/sec.        For the function given by from Preview Activity , find the most simplified expression you can for the average velocity of the ball on the interval . Use your result to compute the average velocity on and to estimate the instantaneous velocity at . Finally, compare your earlier work in Activity .    Note that .         Observe first that . Next, recall that , so .  Now, since we assume , we can simplify further to find that . Setting , it follows ft\/sec, and letting approach zero, we see that will approach , so the instantaneous velocity at appears to be feet\/sec. Both results match our earlier work in Activity .      Summary     For an object moving in a straight line with position function , the average velocity  average velocity of the object on the interval from to , denoted , is given by the formula .

Show your work and explain your reasoning, and include units on your answer.    Among the average and instantaneous velocities you computed in earlier questions, which are positive and which are negative? What does negative velocity indicate?          .         Most negative average velocity on ; most positive average velocity on .     feet per second.    The average velocities are negative; the instantaneous velocity was positive. Downward motion corresponds to negative average velocity; upward motion to positive average velocity.         Since and , the bungee jumper's change in vertical position between  is .    We estimate the jumper's average velocity using the formula . Using the approximations from part (a) and , we have The units on each of these average velocities are ``feet per second''.    On the time interval the jumper has the greatest change in position over that period of time, so it is on that interval that her average velocity is greatest in magnitude (but negative in sign). For the same reasons, the largest (positive) average velocity will occur on the interval .    We can approximate the jumper's average velocity on the intervals and and find the average of these average velocities. This will give us the slope of the secant line connecting the points and and be a reasonably good approximation to the instantaneous velocity at . Now so the jumper's instantaneous velocity at is about feet per second.    The average velocities we calculated were all negative, while the instantaneous velocity was positive. When the jumper is moving in the downward direction, the average velocity will be negative (indicating a decrease in position), while a positive average velocity indicates an increase in position (moving upwards).       A diver leaps from a 3 meter springboard. His feet leave the board at time , he reaches his maximum height of 4.5 m at seconds, and enters the water at . Once in the water, the diver coasts to the bottom of the pool (depth 3.5 m), touches bottom at , rests for one second, and then pushes off the bottom. From there he coasts to the surface, and takes his first breath at .     Let denote the function that gives the height of the diver's feet (in meters) above the water at time .

Is his average velocity the same on every time interval within ?    Let the function represent the instantaneous vertical velocity of the diver at time (i.e. the speed at which the height function is changing; note that velocity in the upward direction is positive, while the velocity of a falling object is negative). Based on your understanding of the diver's behavior, as well as your graph of the position function, sketch a carefully labeled graph of on the axes provided in Figure . Include scale and units on the vertical axis. Write several sentences that explain how you constructed your graph, discussing when you expect to be zero, positive, negative, relatively large, and relatively small.    Is there a connection between the two graphs that you can describe? What can you say about the velocity graph when the height function is increasing? decreasing? Make as many observations as you can.         Sketch a plot where the diver's height at time is on the vertical axis. For instance, .      m\/sec. The average velocity is not the same on every time interval within .    When the diver is going upward, her velocity is positive. When she is going downward, her velocity is negative. At the peak of her dive and when her feet touch the bottom of the pool.     It looks like when the position function is steep, the velocity function's value is farther away from zero, and that whenever the height\/position function is rising\/increasing, the velocity function has a positive value. Similarly, whenever the position function is decreasing, the velocity is negative.         Taking into account the given information and our intuition about the diver's velocity, ketch a plot where the diver's height at time is on the vertical axis. For instance, .     First, we see that m\/sec. The average velocity is not the same on every time interval within , since the position function is not linear. Physically, we expect the water to make the diver's velocity change as she glides through the water.    When the diver is going upward, her velocity is positive. When she is going downward, her velocity is negative. At the peak of her dive and when her feet touch the bottom of the pool, her velocity is zero because the velocity is changing sign there. Sketch a possible graph accordingly.     It looks like when the position function is steep, the velocity function's value is farther away from zero, and that whenever the height\/position function is rising\/increasing, the velocity function has a positive value. Similarly, whenever the position function is decreasing, the velocity is negative.

  "body": " The notion of limit     What is the mathematical notion of limit and what role do limits play in the study of functions?    What is the meaning of the notation ?    How do we go about determining the value of the limit of a function at a point?    How do we manipulate average velocity to compute instantaneous velocity?      In Section 1.1 we used a function, , to model the location of a moving object at a given time. Functions can model other interesting phenomena, such as the rate at which an automobile consumes gasoline at a given velocity, or the reaction of a patient to a given dosage of a drug. We can use calculus to study how a function value changes in response to changes in the input variable.  Think about the falling ball whose position function is given by . Its average velocity on the interval is given by .  Note that the average velocity is a function of . That is, the function tells us the average velocity of the ball on the interval from to . To find the instantaneous velocity of the ball when , we need to know what happens to as gets closer and closer to . But also notice that is not defined, because it leads to the quotient .  This is where the notion of a limit comes in. By using a limit, we can investigate the behavior of as gets arbitrarily close, but not equal, to . We first use the graph of a function to explore points where interesting behavior occurs.       The Notion of Limit  Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest. We need a precise understanding of what it means to say a function has limit as approaches . To begin, think about a recent example.  In Preview Activity , we saw that as gets closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, gets as close as we want to the value 4. At first, this may feel counterintuitive, because the value of is , not . But limits describe the behavior of a function arbitrarily close to a fixed input, and the value of the function at the fixed input does not matter. More formally, What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit. To be completely precise, it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say as close to as we like and sufficiently close to . That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits. The definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text. we say the following.    Given a function , a fixed input , and a real number , we say that has limit as approaches , limit definition and write provided that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . If we cannot make as close to a single value as we would like as approaches , then we say that does not have a limit as approaches .       For the function pictured in Figure , we make the following observations: . When working from a graph, it suffices to ask if the function approaches a single value from each side of the fixed input. The function value at the fixed input is irrelevant. This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.  However, does not have a limit as . There is a jump in the graph at . If we approach from the left, the function values tend to get close to 3, but if we approach from the right, the function values get close to 2. There is no single number that all of these function values approach. This is why the limit of does not exist at .    For any function , there are typically three ways to answer the question does have a limit at , and if so, what is the limit? The first is to reason graphically as we have just done with the example from Preview Activity . If we have a formula for , there are two additional possibilities:  Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach on either side (typically using some sort of computing technology), and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.  Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach .  The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit, while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.   Limits of Two Functions   For each of the following functions, we'd like to know whether or not the function has a limit at the stated -values. Use both numerical and algebraic approaches to investigate and, if possible, estimate or determine the value of the limit. Compare the results with a careful graph of the function on an interval containing the points of interest.     ; ,    ; ,       a. We first construct a graph of along with tables of values near and .    Table of values near .                                           Table of values near .                                           Plot of on .     From Table , it appears that we can make as close as we want to 3 by taking sufficiently close to , which suggests that . This is also consistent with the graph of . To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view, consider the formula for : . As , , and , so as , the numerator of tends to 3 and the denominator tends to 1, hence .  The situation is more complicated when , because is not defined. If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator, we observe that as , , and , so as , the numerator and denominator of both tend to 0. We call an indeterminate form . indeterminate form This tells us that there is somehow more work to do. From Table and Figure , it appears that should have a limit of at .  To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that .  It is important to observe that, since we are taking the limit as , we are considering values that are close, but not equal, to . Because we never actually allow to equal , the quotient has value 1 for every possible value of . Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above, and find that . This limit is now easy to determine, and its value clearly is . Thus, from several points of view we've seen that .  b. Next we turn to the function , and construct two tables and a graph.    Table of values near .                                           Table of values near .                                           Plot of on .     First, as , it appears from the table values that the function is approaching a number between and . From the graph it appears that as . The exact value of is , which is approximately 0.8660254038. This is convincing evidence that .  As , we observe that does not behave in an elementary way. When is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and increases without bound. When is negative and approaching zero, decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to , the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of betweem and . If we plot the function with a graphing utility and then zoom in on , we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin, which suggests that does not have a limit at .  How do we reconcile the graph with the righthand table above, which seems to suggest that the limit of as approaches may in fact be ? The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values . When we evaluate , we get for each positive integer value of . But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero, say , then we find that .  That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is . Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit, so has no limit as .    An important lesson to take from Example is that tables can be misleading when determining the value of a limit. While a table of values is useful for investigating the possible value of a limit, we should also use other tools to confirm the value.    Estimate the value of each of the following limits by constructing appropriate tables of values. Then determine the exact value of the limit by using algebra to simplify the function. Finally, plot each function on an appropriate interval to check your result visually.           can be factored.  Expand the expression , and then combine like terms in the numerator.  Try multiplying the given function by this fancy form of 1: .        .  .  .      Estimating the values of the limits with tables is straightforward and should suggest the exact values stated below.     .   .   .      Recall that our primary motivation for considering limits of functions comes from our interest in studying the rate of change of a function. To that end, we close this section by revisiting our previous work with average and instantaneous velocity and highlighting the role that limits play.    Instantaneous Velocity  Suppose that we have a moving object whose position at time is given by a function . We know that the average velocity of the object on the time interval is . We define the instantaneous velocity  instantaneous velocity at to be the limit of average velocity as approaches . Note particularly that as , the length of the time interval gets shorter and shorter (while always including ). We will write for the instantaneous velocity at , and thus .  Equivalently, if we think of the changing value as being of the form , where is some small number, then we may instead write .  Again, the most important idea here is that to compute instantaneous velocity, we take a limit of average velocities as the time interval shrinks.    Consider a moving object whose position function is given by , where is measured in meters and is measured in minutes.     Determine the most simplified expression for the average velocity of the object on the interval , where .    Determine the average velocity of the object on the interval . Include units on your answer.   Determine the instantaneous velocity of the object when . Include units on your answer.        .  Recall that .  Consider and use your work in (a).        .  meters\/min.  meters per minute.        Observe that .  Using the expression just found in (a) with , meters\/min.  Taking the limit of average velocity and using our work from (a), we find that , so the instantaneous velocity of the object when is 6 meters per minute.      The closing activity of this section asks you to make some connections among average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and slopes of certain lines.    For the moving object whose position at time is given by the graph in Figure , answer each of the following questions. Assume that is measured in feet and is measured in seconds.   Plot of the position function in Activity .      Use the graph to estimate the average velocity of the object on each of the following intervals: , , . Draw each line whose slope represents the average velocity you seek.  How could you use average velocities or slopes of lines to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the object at a fixed time?  Use the graph to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the object when . Should this instantaneous velocity at be greater or less than the average velocity on that you computed in (a)? Why?        Remember that average velocity on an interval computes the quotient of change in over change in . This is the slope of the line between the corresponding two points on the graph of .  Think about shorter and shorter time intervals and drawing the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.  Think about zooming in on the graph at and drawing a line that, up close, looks just like the curve . What is the approximate slope of that line?         , , and .  Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity. If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity.  The instantaneous velocity at is greater than the average velocity on .        The average velocity on is the slope of the line joining the points and , which is . On , we similarly find , and on , we have .  Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity. If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity. For example, to estimate the instantaneous velocity at , we might consider average velocities on , , and .  If we draw the line through and , it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5: if we go over one grid-width, we appear to go up about 2.5. The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through and , which is 2. Hence the instantaneous velocity at is greater than the average velocity on .        Summary     Limits enable us to examine trends in function behavior near a specific point. In particular, taking a limit at a given point asks if the function values nearby tend to approach a particular fixed value.    We read , as the limit of as approaches is , which means that we can make the value of as close to as we want by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to .    To find for a given value of and a known function , we can estimate this value from the graph of , or we can make a table of function values for -values that are closer and closer to . If we want the exact value of the limit, we can work with the function algebraically to understand how different parts of the formula for change as .    We find the instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time by taking the limit of average velocities of the object over shorter and shorter time intervals containing the time of interest.       Evaluating a limit using a graph  Evaluating a limit algebraically   Consider the function whose formula is .    What is the domain of ?  Use a sequence of values of near to estimate the value of , if you think the limit exists. If you think the limit doesn't exist, explain why.

By factoring the numerator and denominator of , we observe that . Taking the limit as , we take values closer and closer, but not equal to 2, and therefore , since for all . Finally, evaluating the last limit as , we see that .    False. In part (a), we saw that is not defined. We now know that has a limit of as approaches , but it is still the case that is undefined.

As we approach from the right, the function values approach (stay constant at) ; but as we approach from the left, the function values approach (stay constant at) . As such, the function values do not get arbitrarily close to a single value, and hence the limit does not exist.    We observe that whenever , and that whenever . So, if , we see that whereas if , it follows that . Because the function value is to the right of and to the left of , it follows that the limit does not exist.

  "body": " The derivative of a function at a point     How is the average rate of change of a function on a given interval defined, and what does this quantity measure?    How is the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a particular point defined? How is the instantaneous rate of change linked to average rate of change?    What is the derivative of a function at a given point? What does this derivative value measure? How do we interpret the derivative value graphically?    How are limits used formally in the computation of derivatives?      The instantaneous rate of change of a function is an idea that sits at the foundation of calculus. It is a generalization of the notion of instantaneous velocity and measures how fast a particular function is changing at a given point. If the original function represents the position of a moving object, this instantaneous rate of change is precisely the velocity of the object. In other contexts, instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day, the number of additional gallons of gasoline consumed by increasing a car's velocity one mile per hour, or the number of dollars added to a mortgage payment for each percentage point increase in interest rate. The instantaneous rate of change can also be interpreted geometrically on the function's graph, and this connection is fundamental to many of the main ideas in calculus.  Recall that for a moving object with position function , its average velocity on the time interval to is given by the quotient .  In a similar way, we make the following definition for an arbitrary function .    For a function , the average rate of change  average rate of change of on the interval is given by the value .    Equivalently, if we want to consider the average rate of change of on , we compute .  It is essential that you understand how the average rate of change of on an interval is connected to its graph.       The Derivative of a Function at a Point  Just as we defined instantaneous velocity in terms of average velocity, we now define the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point in terms of the average rate of change of the function over related intervals. This instantaneous rate of change of at  instantaneous rate of change is called the derivative of at , and is denoted by .    Let be a function and a value in the function's domain. We define the derivative of with respect to evaluated at , derivative definition denoted , by the formula , provided this limit exists.    Aloud, we read the symbol as either -prime at or the derivative of evaluated at . Much of the next several chapters will be devoted to understanding, computing, applying, and interpreting derivatives. For now, we observe the following important things.     The derivative of at the value is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of on the interval as . This limit may not exist, so not every function has a derivative at every point.  We say that a function is differentiable  differentiable at if it has a derivative at .  The derivative is a generalization of the instantaneous velocity of a position function: if is a position function of a moving body, tells us the instantaneous velocity of the body at time .  Because the units on are units of per unit of , the derivative has these very same units. For instance, if measures position in feet and measures time in seconds, the units on are feet per second.  Because the quantity represents the slope of the line through and , when we compute the derivative we are taking the limit of a collection of slopes of lines. Thus, the derivative itself represents the slope of a particularly important line.     We first consider the derivative at a given value as the slope of a certain line.  When we compute an instantaneous rate of change, we allow the interval to shrink as . We can think of one endpoint of the interval as sliding towards the other. In particular, provided that has a derivative at , the point will approach as . Because the process of taking a limit is a dynamic one, it can be helpful to use computing technology to visualize it. One option is a java applet in which the user is able to control the point that is moving. For a helpful collection of examples, consider the work of David Austin of Grand Valley State University, and this particularly relevant example . For applets that have been built in Geogebra You can even consider building your own examples; the fantastic program Geogebra is available for free download and is easy to learn and use. , see Marc Renault's library via Shippensburg University, with this example being especially fitting for our work in this section.   Figure shows a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points and , generated by different values of . These lines (shown in the first three figures in magenta), are often called secant lines  secant line to the curve . A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points on the curve. For each such line, the slope of the secant line is , where the value of depends on the location of the point we choose. We can see in the diagram how, as , the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point . If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists, we say that the resulting value is the slope of the tangent line to the curve. This tangent line tangent line (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of at the point has slope .   A sequence of secant lines approaching the tangent line to at .    If the tangent line at exists, the graph of looks like a straight line when viewed up close at . In Figure we combine the four graphs in Figure into the single one on the left, and zoom in on the box centered at on the right. Note how the tangent line sits relative to the curve at and how closely it resembles the curve near .   A sequence of secant lines approaching the tangent line to at . At right, we zoom in on the point . The slope of the tangent line (in green) to at is given by .

The following example demonstrates several key ideas involving the derivative of a function.

In addition, discuss the meaning of this value and draw a labeled graph that supports your explanation.    From the limit definition, we know that .  Now we use the rule for , and observe that and . Substituting these values into the limit definition, we have that .  In order to let , we must simplify the quotient. Expanding and distributing in the numerator, .  Combining like terms, we have .  Next, we remove a common factor of in both the numerator and denominator and find that .  Finally, we are able to take the limit as , and thus conclude that .

Suppose that the population, , of China (in billions) can be approximated by the function where is the number of years since the start of 1993.    According to the model, what was the total change in the population of China between January 1, 1993 and January 1, 2000?

We will say that today's date is July 1, 2015, which means that ;  billions of people per year.     .         First, billion people is the total population change. It follows that the average rate of change over this time period is billion people per year.

  "body": " The derivative function     How does the limit definition of the derivative of a function lead to an entirely new (but related) function ?    What is the difference between writing and ?    How is the graph of the derivative function related to the graph of ?    What are some examples of functions for which is not defined at one or more points?      We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function at , or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at , is given by the value . In all of our examples so far, we have identified a particular value of as our point of interest: , , etc. But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one -value, and possibly for many of them. In this section, we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for at any point . Indeed, the process of taking the derivative generates a new function, denoted by , derived from the original function .   Consider the function .   Use the limit definition to compute the derivative values: , , , and .    Observe that the work to find is the same, regardless of the value of . Based on your work in (a), what do you conjecture is the value of ? How about ? (Note: you should not use the limit definition of the derivative to find either value.)    Conjecture a formula for that depends only on the value . That is, in the same way that we have a formula for (recall ), see if you can use your work above to guess a formula for in terms of .        How the derivative is itself a function  In your work in Preview Activity with , you may have found several patterns. One comes from observing that , , , and . That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that and . We also observe that the particular value of has very little effect on the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition. To see this more clearly, we compute , where represents a number to be named later. Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative, .  Here we observe that neither nor depend on the value of , so as , . Thus, .  This result is consistent with the specific values we found above: e.g., . And indeed, our work confirms that the value of has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative. We note further that the letter being used is immaterial: whether we call it , , or anything else, the derivative at a given value is simply given by 4 minus 2 times the value. We choose to use for consistency with the original function given by , as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function. For the function , it follows that .  Because the value of the derivative function is linked to the graph of the original function, it makes sense to look at both of these functions plotted on the same domain.   The graphs of (at left) and (at right). Slopes on the graph of correspond to heights on the graph of .    In Figure , on the left we show a plot of together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we've considered above. On the right, we show a plot of with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points. Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs: the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way: the slope of the tangent line at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the height at the corresponding point on the righthand graph. That is, at each respective value of , the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the height of the derivative function. Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different: in the left graph, the vertical units are simply the output units of . On the righthand graph of , the units on the vertical axis are units of per unit of .  An excellent way to explore how the graph of generates the graph of is through an applet. See, for instance, the applets at gvsu.edu\/s\/5C or gvsu.edu\/s\/5D , via the sites of David Austin and Marc Renault .  In Section when we first defined the derivative, we wrote the definition in terms of a value to find . As we have seen above, the letter is merely a placeholder, and it often makes more sense to use instead. For the record, here we restate the definition of the derivative. derivative definition     Let be a function and a value in the function's domain. We define the derivative of , a new function called , by the formula , provided this limit exists.    We now have two different ways of thinking about the derivative function:  given a graph of , how does this graph lead to the graph of the derivative function ? and  given a formula for , how does the limit definition of derivative generate a formula for ?  Both of these issues are explored in the following activities.    For each given graph of , sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function, , on the axes immediately below. The scale of the grid for the graph of is ; assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of is identical to that for . If necessary, adjust and label the vertical scale on the axes for .  When you are finished with all 8 graphs, write several sentences that describe your overall process for sketching the graph of the derivative function, given the graph the original function. What are the values of the derivative function that you tend to identify first? What do you do thereafter? How do key traits of the graph of the derivative function exemplify properties of the graph of the original function?                Points where the slope of the tangent line is equal to zero are particularly important. Try finding these points first in your effort to plot and plotting those zero values on the axes where you'll graph .                                For a dynamic investigation that allows you to experiment with graphing when given the graph of , see this appled by Marc Renault .  Now, recall the opening example of this section: we began with the function and used the limit definition of the derivative to show that , or equivalently that . We subsequently graphed the functions and as shown in Figure . Following Activity , we now understand that we could have constructed a fairly accurate graph of  without knowing a formula for either or . At the same time, it is useful to know a formula for the derivative function whenever it is possible to find one.  In the next activity, we further explore the more algebraic approach to finding : given a formula for , the limit definition of the derivative will be used to develop a formula for .    For each of the listed functions, determine a formula for the derivative function. For the first two, determine the formula for the derivative by thinking about the nature of the given function and its slope at various points; do not use the limit definition. For the latter four, use the limit definition. Pay careful attention to the function names and independent variables. It is important to be comfortable with using letters other than and . For example, given a function , we call its derivative .                                       What is the slope of the function at every point?    What is the slope of the function at every point?                               .     .     .     .     .     .           because the slope of the tangent line to the horizontal line given by is zero at every value of .     because the slope of the tangent line to the line given by is 1 at every value of .                     Summary     The limit definition of the derivative, , produces a value for each at which the derivative is defined, and this leads to a new function . It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function ( ) and produces a new, related function ( ).    There is essentially no difference between writing (as we did regularly in Section ) and writing . In either case, the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.    Given the graph of a function , we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative by observing that heights on the derivative's graph correspond to slopes on the original function's graph.    In Activity , we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs, such as the shifted absolute value function. At such points, the derivative fails to exist, and we say that is not differentiable there. For now, it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.       The derivative function graphically   Consider the function shown in the graph below.   (Note that you can click on the graph to get a larger version of it, and that it may be useful to print that larger version to be able to work with it by hand.)  Carefully sketch the derivative function of the given function (you will want to estimate values on the derivative function at different values as you do this). Use your derivative function graph to estimate the following values on the derivative function.    at  -3  -1  1  3    the derivative is                             , we estimate the derivative by estimating the slope (=rise\/run) from the graph. This allows us to both sketch the graph of the derivative and estimate the derivatives that are requested. The derivative (in red) is shown with the original function (in blue) below. From the graph and our calculations, it appears that , , , and .      Applying the limit definition of the derivative   Find a formula for the derivative of the function using difference quotients:      .  (In the first answer blank, fill in the numerator of the difference quotient you use to evaluate the derivative. In the second, fill out the derivative you obtain after completing the limit calculation.)                     Sketching the derivative   For the function shown in the graph below, sketch a graph of the derivative. You will then be picking which of the following is the correct derivative graph, but should be sure to first sketch the derivative yourself.   Which of the following graphs is the derivative of ?   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    (Click on a graph to enlarge it.)    1.  2.  3.  4.    5.  6.  7.  8.          , we know that the derivative is negative where is decreasing and positive where it is increasing. Applying this to , we see that the derivative must be which is answer 6.      Comparing function and derivative values   The graph of a function is shown below.   At which of the labeled -values is  least?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6    greatest?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6    least?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6    greatest?    x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6                         are those locations where the vertical coordinate on the graph is the smallest and largest, which are x3 and x6, respectively. The smallest and largest values of the derivative are where the slope of the function is smallest and largest, which are x6 and x5.

The fact that is differentiable everywhere means that the graph of is smooth everywhere. The slopes of the tangent lines to are negative but increasing on the interval and positive and increasing on the interval , with a slope of when . This is the kind of behavior that a quadratic function possesses, so we could guess that has a graph something like that shown in the figure below.    Because the change in the derivative values is constant, it looks like is linear with a slope of , passing through the point , so it is reasonable to guess that . A plot of is shown at right in the figure below.       A natural guess is ; since we need the function to pass through the point , we might try . Using the limit definition, we have . So this guess is close, but is off by a factor of , since we want . Instead, if we use (note that we chose the `` '' so that , then we have . This appears to be the correct function .       Consider the function .   Use the limit definition of the derivative to determine a formula for .

The coefficient on the linear term in appears to make the `` '' appear in . The leading coefficient in leads to the coefficient of `` '' in .         By definition, .       In the above figure, we see plots of both and . We observe that the point is the vertex of the quadratic function , and at this point the slope of the tangent line to is zero. This aligns with the point where crosses the -axis. In addition, we note that is negative for , which corresponds to where is decreasing and has tangent lines with slopes that are negative. Similarly, the values of are positive for , which align with the values of slopes we see on the original function .    By definition, .    For , we found that . For , we determined that . The constants and don't seem to affect the results at all, and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of and vertically, which does nothing to change the slope. The coefficient on the linear term in appears to make the `` '' appear in . That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function , the slope would everywhere be , in contrast to the coefficent found on the linear term in , which leads to the constant in . Finally, the leading coefficient in leads to the coefficient of `` '' in . This makes sense because if we considered only , the would make the graph times as steep as the graph of , and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.       Let be a continuous function (that is, one with no jumps or holes in the graph) and suppose that a graph of is given by the graph on the right in Figure .   Axes for plotting and, at right, the graph of .       Observe that for every value of that satisfies , the value of is constant. What does this tell you about the behavior of the graph of on this interval?    On what intervals other than do you expect to be a linear function? Why?    At which values of is not defined? What behavior does this lead you to expect to see in the graph of ?    Suppose that . On the axes provided at left in Figure , sketch an accurate graph of .          is linear.    On , and .

  "body": " Interpreting, estimating, and using the derivative     In contexts other than the position of a moving object, what does the derivative of a function measure?    What are the units on the derivative function , and how are they related to the units of the original function ?    What is a central difference, and how can one be used to estimate the value of the derivative at a point from given function data?    Given the value of the derivative of a function at a point, what can we infer about how the value of the function changes nearby?      It is a powerful feature of mathematics that it can be studied both as abstract discipline and as an applied one. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of functions. At the same time, if we consider functions that represent meaningful processes, calculus can describe our experience of physical reality. We have already seen that for the position function of a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the derivative of the position function, , gives the ball's velocity at time .  In this section, we investigate several functions with specific physical meaning, and consider how the units on the independent variable, dependent variable, and the derivative function add to our understanding. To start, we consider the familiar problem of a position function of a moving object.   One of the longest stretches of straight (and flat) road in North America can be found on the Great Plains in the state of North Dakota on state highway 46, which lies just south of the interstate highway I-94 and runs through the town of Gackle. A car leaves town (at time ) and heads east on highway 46; its position in miles from Gackle at time in minutes is given by the graph of the function in Figure . Three important points are labeled on the graph; where the curve looks linear, assume that it is indeed a straight line.   The graph of , the position of the car along highway 46, which tells its distance in miles from Gackle, ND, at time in minutes.       In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval. In particular, discuss what is happening on the time intervals and .    Find the slope of the line between the points and . What are the units on this slope? What does the slope represent?    Find the average rate of change of the car's position on the interval . Include units on your answer.    Estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the car's position at the moment . Write a sentence to explain your reasoning and the meaning of this value.        Units of the derivative function  As we now know, the derivative of the function at a fixed value is given by , and this value has several different interpretations. If we set , one meaning of is the slope of the tangent line at the point .  We also sometimes write or instead of , and these alternate notations help us see the units (and thus the meaning) of the derivative as the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to . instantaneous rate of change The units on the slope of the secant line, , are units of per unit of , and when we take the limit as goes to zero, the derivative has the same units: units of per unit of . It is helpful to remember that the units on the derivative function are units of output per unit of input, for the variables of the original function.  For example, suppose that the function measures the population of a city (in thousands) at the start of year (where corresponds to 2010 AD). We are told that . What is the meaning of this value? Well, since is measured in thousands and is measured in years, we can say that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2012 is 21.37 thousand people per year. We therefore expect that in the coming year, about 21,370 people will be added to the city's population.    Toward more accurate derivative estimates  Recall that to estimate the value of at a given , we calculate a difference quotient  difference quotient  with a relatively small value of . We should use both positive and negative values of in order to account for the behavior of the function on both sides of the point of interest. To that end, we introduce the notion of a central difference and its role in estimating derivatives.    Suppose that is a function for which three values are known: , , and . Estimate .    We know that . But since we don't have a graph or a formula for the function, we can neither sketch a tangent line nor evaluate the limit algebraically. We can't even use smaller and smaller values of to estimate the limit. Instead, we have just two choices: using or , depending on which point we pair with .  So, one estimate is .  The other is .  Because the first approximation looks backward from the point and the second approximation looks forward, it makes sense to average these two estimates in order to account for behavior on both sides of . Doing so, we find that .    The intuitive approach to average the two estimates found in Example is in fact the best possible way estimate to a derivative when we have just two function values for on opposite sides of the point of interest.   At left, the graph of along with the secant line through and , the secant line through and , as well as the tangent line. At right, the same graph along with the secant line through and , plus the tangent line.    To see why, we think about the diagram in Figure . On the left, we see the two secant lines with slopes that come from computing the backward difference  backward difference  and from the forward difference  forward difference  . Note how the first slope over-estimates the slope of the tangent line at , while the second slope underestimates . On the right, we see the secant line whose slope is given by the central difference  central difference  .  Note that this central difference has the same value as the average of the forward and backward differences (and it is straightforward to explain why this always holds). The central difference yields a very good approximation to the derivative's value, because it yields a line closer to being parallel to the tangent line.  The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by . This quantity measures the slope of the secant line to through the points and .    A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time is measured in minutes.   Temperature data in degrees Fahrenheit.                            Use a central difference to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature of the potato at . Include units on your answer.    Use a central difference to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature of the potato at . Include units on your answer.    Without doing any calculation, which do you expect to be greater: or ? Why?    Suppose it is given that and . What are the units on these two quantities? What do you expect the temperature of the potato to be when ? when ? Why?    Write a couple of careful sentences that describe the behavior of the temperature of the potato on the time interval , as well as the behavior of the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature of the potato on the same time interval.          Think about quantities such as .    See the note in (a).    Is changing faster at or at ?    Remember that the units on will be degrees Fahrenheit per minute.     Be careful to distinguish between the temperature, , and the rate of change of temperature, , in your commentary.           degrees per minute.     degrees per minute.     .    The value is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64, while measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant , and its units are degrees per minute. Because at time the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at , the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at , or in other words . Similarly, at , two minutes have elapsed from , so we expect an increase of degrees: .    Throughout the time interval , the temperature of the potato is increasing. But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing. That is, while the values of continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.           Using the central difference, we find that degrees per minute.    Using the central difference, we find that degrees per minute.    Over each subsequent time interval, we see that the amount of increase in the potato's temperature gets less and less, thus we expect the value of to get smaller and smaller as time goes on. We therefore expect .    The value is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64, while measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant , and its units are degrees per minute. Because at time the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at , the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at , or in other words . Similarly, at , two minutes have elapsed from , so we expect an increase of degrees: .    Throughout the time interval , the temperature of the potato is increasing. But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing. That is, while the values of continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.          A company manufactures rope, and the total cost of producing feet of rope is dollars.   What does it mean to say that ?    What are the units of ?    Suppose that and . Estimate , and justify your estimate by writing at least one sentence that explains your thinking.    Do you think is less than, equal to, or greater than ? Why?    Suppose someone claims that . What would the practical meaning of this derivative value tell you about the approximate cost of the next foot of rope? Is this possible? Why or why not?          The cost of producing 2000 feet of rope is     Remember that the units on any derivative are units of output per unit of input.     How much do you expect to increase for each additional foot away from 2000? By how many feet will the input increase to get to 2100?    In manufacturing processes, there is often a decrease in cost per unit as the number of units increases.    Is it possible for the total cost function to be decreasing at some point?          It costs $800 to make 2000 feet of rope.     dollars per foot.      ,.    Either or .    Impossible. The total cost function can never decrease.           means that it costs $800 to make 2000 feet of rope.    The units of are dollars per foot.     If and , then we know once 2000 feet of rope are produced, the total cost function is increasing at $0.35 per additional foot of rope. Then, if we manufacture an additional 100 feet of rope, the additional total cost will be approximately . Therefore, we find that , or that the cost to make 2100 feet of rope is about $835.    Either or , since we expect the cost per foot of additional rope to either stay constant or to get smaller as the production volume increases. Said differently, the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost function should either be constant or decrease due to economy of scale.    It is impossible to have and indeed to have any negative derivative value for the total cost function. The total cost function can never decrease, because it doesn't make sense for the total cost of producing 5001 feet of rope to be less than the total cost of producing 5000 feet of rope.         Researchers at a major car company have found a function that relates gasoline consumption to speed for a particular model of car. In particular, they have determined that the consumption , in liters per kilometer , at a given speed , is given by a function , where is the car's speed in kilometers per hour .   Data provided by the car company tells us that , , and . Use this information to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of fuel consumption with respect to speed at . Be as accurate as possible, use proper notation, and include units on your answer.    By writing a complete sentence, interpret the meaning (in the context of fuel consumption) of .     Write at least one complete sentence that interprets the meaning of the value of that you estimated in (a).          Try a central difference.    What is happening when the car is traveling at 80 km\/hr?    Remember that units on the derivative are units of output per unit of input.            liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.    At 80 kilometers per hour, the car is using fuel at a rate of 0.015 liters per kilometer.    When the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour, its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.          Using a central difference, we have which tells us that liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.    When the car is traveling at 80 kilometers per hour, it is using fuel at a rate of 0.015 liters per kilometer. That is, at the given speed, for each additional kilometer the car travels, it uses an additional 0.015 liters of fuel.    To say that liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour means that when the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour, its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour. If we increase our speed from 90 to 91 km\/hr, we would expect our rate of fuel consumption to rise by 0.0006 liters for each additional kilometer driven.       In Section , we learned how use to the graph of a given function to plot the graph of its derivative, . It is important to remember that when we do so, the scale and the units on the vertical axis often have to change to represent . For example, suppose that tells us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of a potato in an oven at time in minutes. In Figure , we sketch the graph of on the left and the graph of on the right.   Plot of at left, and its derivative at right.    Notice that the vertical scales are different in size and different in units, as the units of are F, while those of are F\/min.    Summary     The derivative of a given function measures the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable with respect to the input variable.    The units on the derivative function are units of per unit of . Again, this measures how fast the output of the function changes when the input of the function changes.    The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by . This quantity measures the slope of the secant line to through the points and . The central difference generates a good approximation of the derivative's value.

The quantity represents the rate at which the coffee is cooling, in degrees per minute, 20 minutes after the cup is put on the counter.

(a) The statement means that it costs 225 dollars to produce 200 gallons of ice cream. (b) The statement means that when the number of gallons produced is 200, costs are increasing by 1.4 dollars\/gallon In other words, it costs about 1.4 dollars to produce the 201st gallon of ice cream.

Fill in the blanks below so that the equation supports his conclusion.                                                    where is weight in pounds and is the number of Calories consumed per day: (a)  means that consuming 1800 cal each day results in a weight of 160 lb (the units of 1800 are cal, and 160 lb).

(A)  (i) Find the average velocity over the time interval [3,4].  Average Velocity = meters per second.  (ii) Find the average velocity over the time interval [3.5,4].

A cup of coffee has its temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at time given by the function , where time is measured in minutes.   Use a central difference with to estimate the value of .    What are the units on the value of that you computed in (a)? What is the practical meaning of the value of ?    Which do you expect to be greater: or ? Why?    Write a sentence that describes the behavior of the function on the time interval . How do you think its graph will look? Why?          .    The coffee's temperature is decreasing at about degrees per minute.     .    We expect to get closer and closer to as time goes on.         Using the central difference formula, we find that .    Since is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and in minutes, we have degrees F per minute. This means that at the instant , the temperature of the coffee is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of about degrees per minute. Said differently, in the next minute, we'd expect the temperature of the coffee to drop about degrees.    We expect the coffee's temperature to decrease quickly early on when the difference between its temperature and the surroundings is greatest, and as time goes on for the coffee's temperature to approach that of the surrounding room. Keeping in mind that is an always decreasing function so that is always negative, we observe that should be less (more negative) than . These observations can also be confirmed by plotting a graph of .    We have noted that is always negative, and that we expect to get closer and closer to as time goes on (that is, is increasing). As such, we expect to look something like the graph of . This is reasonable since is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches as increases.       The temperature change (in Fahrenheit degrees), in a patient, that is generated by a dose (in milliliters), of a drug, is given by the function .   What does it mean to say ? Write a complete sentence to explain, using correct units.    A person's sensitivity, , to the drug is defined by the function . What are the units of sensitivity?    Suppose that . Write a complete sentence to explain the meaning of this value. Include in your response the information given in (a).         If a patient takes a dose of ml of a drug, the patient will experience a body temperature change of degrees F.    ``degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter.''    For a patient taking a ml dose, adding one more ml to the dose leads us to expect a temperature change that is about degrees less than the temperature change induced by a ml dose.         To say that means that if a patient takes a dose of ml of a drug, the patient will experience a body temperature change of degrees F.    Since the units of are degrees F and the units of are ml, it follows that the units of are ``degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter.''    If degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter, this means that the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature change function is degrees F per ml at the dose-level of ml. This means that for a patient taking a ml dose, adding one more ml to the dose leads us to expect a temperature change that is about degrees less than the temperature change induced by a ml dose.       The velocity of a ball that has been tossed vertically in the air is given by , where is measured in feet per second, and is measured in seconds. The ball is in the air from until .   When is the ball's velocity greatest?    Determine the value of . Justify your thinking.    What are the units on the value of ? What does this value and the corresponding units tell you about the behavior of the ball at time ?    What is the physical meaning of the function ?          .     .    ``feet per second per second''; tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second.    The acceleration of the ball.         Observe that is a linear function with negative slope , and thus decreasing. Since the function is of interest from to , the velocity is greatest at the left endpoint, when . This greatest velocity is feet per second.    Since is a linear function, its slope is constant, and hence the slope of every tangent line to the function is the same as the slope of the line the function generates. Thus, .    Because is measured in feet per second and in seconds, the units on are ``feet per second per second.'' Knowing that , this tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second; that is, for whatever the ball's velocity is at , we would expect the velocity to decrease by (exactly) feet per second over the next one second. (Normally this total decrease would be approximate, not exact, but since the velocity function is linear, we can compute the exact total change.)    The instantaneous rate of change of velocity is precisely the acceleration of the ball. Indeed, tells us how the ball's velocity changes, and that it does so at a constant rate of feet per second per second. This is also consistent with the fact that acceleration due to gravity is constant.       The value, , of a particular automobile (in dollars) depends on the number of miles, , the car has been driven, according to the function .   Suppose that and . What is the average rate of change of on the interval , and what are the units on this value?    In addition to the information given in (a), say that . Determine the best possible estimate of and write one sentence to explain the meaning of your result, including units on your answer.    Which value do you expect to be greater: or ? Why?    Write a sentence to describe the long-term behavior of the function , plus another sentence to describe the long-term behavior of . Provide your discussion in practical terms regarding the value of the car and the rate at which that value is changing.          dollars per mile.     dollars per mile. During st mile, we expect the car's value to drop by dollars.     .    The graph of might have the general shape of the graph of for positive values of : always positive, always decreasing, and bending upwards while tending to as increases.         To find the average rate of change of on the interval , we divide the change in values (in dollars) on this interval by the change in values (in miles) to obtain dollars per mile. This tells us that from the mileage of to miles, on average the car's value decreases by dollars per mile driven.    Since and are equidistant from , we use the central difference quotient to approximate the derivative of at to obtain dollars per mile. This approximation tells us that at the instant the car has been driven miles, the car's value is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of dollars per mile. That is, during st mile, we'd expect the car's value to drop by dollars.    As we pile up miles on our car, we expect the value to go down. However, we should expect the depreciation to be more extreme at first, but less in magnitude as we drive more miles and our car gets older. Note, though, the the value of the car is always decreasing and is always negative. Thus, we should expect that the rate of change of is increasing (becoming less negative) as increases and that .    The value of a car is never negative. So we know that for all . A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that for all . The fact that the depreciation slows as increases implies that is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since is increasing, it follows that is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of might have the general shape of the graph of for positive values of .       "

  "title": "The second derivative",
  "body": " The second derivative     How does the derivative of a function tell us whether the function is increasing or decreasing on an interval?    What can we learn by taking the derivative of the derivative (the second derivative) of a function ?    What does it mean to say that a function is concave up or concave down? How are these characteristics connected to certain properties of the derivative of the function?    What are the units of the second derivative? How do they help us understand the rate of change of the rate of change?      Given a differentiable function , we know that its derivative, , is a related function whose output at tells us the slope of the tangent line to at the point . That is, heights on the derivative graph tell us the values of slopes on the original function's graph.  At a point where is positive, the slope of the tangent line to is positive. Therefore, on an interval where is positive, the function is increasing (or rising). increasing Similarly, if is negative on an interval, the graph of is decreasing decreasing (or falling).  The derivative of tells us not only whether the function is increasing or decreasing on an interval, but also how the function is increasing or decreasing. Look at the two tangent lines shown in Figure . We see that near point the value of is positive and relatively close to zero, and near that point the graph is rising slowly. By contrast, near point , the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value, and is decreasing rapidly near .   Two tangent lines on a graph.    Besides asking whether the value of the derivative function is positive or negative and whether it is large or small, we can also ask how is the derivative changing?   Because the derivative, , is itself a function, we can consider taking its derivative the derivative of the derivative and ask what does the derivative of the derivative tell us about how the original function behaves? We start with an investigation of a moving object.   The position of a car driving along a straight road at time in minutes is given by the function that is pictured in Figure . The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet. For instance, the point on the graph indicates that after 2 minutes, the car has traveled 4000 feet.   The graph of , the position of the car (measured in thousands of feet from its starting location) at time in minutes.       In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval. In particular, you should carefully discuss what is happening on each of the time intervals , , , , and , plus provide commentary overall on what the car is doing on the interval .    On the lefthand axes provided in Figure , sketch a careful, accurate graph of .    What is the meaning of the function in the context of the given problem? What can we say about the car's behavior when is positive? when is zero? when is negative?    Rename the function you graphed in (b) to be called . Describe the behavior of in words, using phrases like is increasing on the interval and is constant on the interval .     Sketch a graph of the function on the righthand axes provide in Figure . Write at least one sentence to explain how the behavior of is connected to the graph of .      Axes for plotting and .       Increasing or decreasing  So far, we have used the words increasing and decreasing intuitively to describe a function's graph. Here we define these terms more formally.    Given a function defined on the interval , we say that is increasing on provided that for all , in the interval , if , then . Similarly, we say that is decreasing on provided that for all , in the interval , if , then .    Simply put, an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph, and a decreasing function is one that falls as the value of the input increases. If the function has a derivative, the sign of the derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing.  Let be a function that is differentiable on an interval . It is possible to show that if for every such that , then is increasing on ; similarly, if on , then is decreasing on .  For example, the function pictured in Figure is increasing on the entire interval , and decreasing on the interval . Note that the value is not included in either interval since at this location, the function is changing from increasing to decreasing.   A function that is decreasing on the intervals and and increasing on and .      The Second Derivative  second derivative  We are now accustomed to investigating the behavior of a function by examining its derivative. The derivative of a function is a new function given by the rule .  Because is itself a function, it is perfectly feasible for us to consider the derivative of the derivative, which is the new function . We call this resulting function the second derivative  second derivative of , and denote the second derivative by . Consequently, we will sometimes call  the first derivative of , rather than simply the derivative of .    The second derivative is defined by the limit definition of the derivative of the first derivative. That is, .    The meaning of the derivative function still holds, so when we compute , this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve , as well as the instantaneous rate of change of . In other words, just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes, the second derivative measures the rate at which the first derivative changes. The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.    Concavity  In addition to asking whether a function is increasing or decreasing, it is also natural to inquire how a function is increasing or decreasing. There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval, as pictured in Figure : the function can increase more and more rapidly, it can increase at the same rate, or it can increase in a way that is slowing down. Fundamentally, we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends, with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all. More than this, we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.   Three functions that are all increasing, but doing so at an increasing rate, at a constant rate, and at a decreasing rate, respectively.    On the leftmost curve in Figure , draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve. As we move from left to right, the slopes of those tangent lines will increase. Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing, and this explains why we say this function is increasing at an increasing rate . For the rightmost graph in Figure , observe that as increases, the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease. This function is increasing at a decreasing rate .  Similar options hold for how a function can decrease. Here we must be extra careful with our language, because decreasing functions involve negative slopes. Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language. For example, it can be tempting to say that is bigger than . But we must remember that greater than describes how numbers lie on a number line: provided that lies to the right of . So of course, is less than . Informally, it might be helpful to say that is more negative than . When a function's values are negative, and those values get more negative as the input increases, the function must be decreasing.   From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.    Now consider the three graphs shown in Figure . Clearly the middle graph depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate. Now, on the first curve, draw a sequence of tangent lines. We see that the slopes of these lines get less and less negative as we move from left to right. That means that the values of the first derivative, while all negative, are increasing, and thus we say that the leftmost curve is decreasing at an increasing rate .  This leaves only the rightmost curve in Figure to consider. For that function, the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval, but as we move from left to right, the slopes get more and more negative. Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing, and we say that the function is decreasing at a decreasing rate .  We now introduce the notion of concavity  concavity which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors. When a curve opens upward on a given interval, like the parabola or the exponential growth function , we say that the curve is concave up on that interval. Likewise, when a curve opens down, like the parabola or the opposite of the exponential function , we say that the function is concave down . Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.  In Figure , we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each. On the lefthand plot, where the function is concave up, observe that the tangent lines always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing as we move from left to right. In other words, the function is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative, , is increasing on that interval. Similarly, on the righthand plot in Figure , where the function shown is concave down, we see that the tangent lines always lie above the curve, and the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right. The fact that its derivative, , is decreasing makes concave down on the interval.   At left, a function that is concave up; at right, one that is concave down.    We state these most recent observations formally as the definitions of the terms concave up and concave down .    Let be a differentiable function on an interval . Then is concave up  concave up on if and only if is increasing on ; is concave down  concave down on if and only if is decreasing on .      The position of a car driving along a straight road at time in minutes is given by the function that is pictured in Figure . The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet. Remember that you worked with this function and sketched graphs of and in Preview Activity .   The graph of , the position of the car (measured in thousands of feet from its starting location) at time in minutes.       On what intervals is the position function increasing? decreasing? Why?    On which intervals is the velocity function increasing? decreasing? neither? Why?     Acceleration  acceleration is defined to be the instantaneous rate of change of velocity, as the acceleration of an object measures the rate at which the velocity of the object is changing. Say that the car's acceleration function is named . How is computed from ? How is computed from ? Explain.    What can you say about whenever is increasing? Why?    Using only the words increasing , decreasing , constant , concave up , concave down , and linear , complete the following sentences. For the position function with velocity and acceleration ,   on an interval where is positive, is .    on an interval where is negative, is .    on an interval where is zero, is .    on an interval where is positive, is .    on an interval where is negative, is .    on an interval where is zero, is .    on an interval where is positive, is .    on an interval where is negative, is .    on an interval where is zero, is .             Remember that a function is increasing on an interval if and only if its first derivative is positive on the interval.    See (a).    Remember that the first derivative of a function measures its instantaneous rate of change.    Think about how .    Be very careful with your letters: , , and .          Increasing: , , , and . Decreasing: never.    Velocity is increasing on , , , and ; is decreasing on , , , and . Velocity is constant on , , and .     and .     is positive since is increasing.        increasing .     decreasing .     constant .     increasing .     decreasing .     constant .     concave up .     concave down .     linear .             The position function increasing on the intervals , , , and , because at every point in such intervals, is positive. For the provided function, is never decreasing because its derivative is never negative.    The velocity function appears to be increasing on the intervals , , , and because the curve is concave up which corresponds to an increasing first derivative . Similarly, appears to be decreasing on the intervals , , , and because the curve is concave down which corresponds to a decreasing first derivative . On the intervals , , and , the position function is constant, and thus linear, so neither concave up nor concave down. This also corresponds to the velocity being constant (since ) on these intervals.    Since is the instantaneous rate of change of , . And because , it follows that , so acceleration is the second derivative of position.    Because is the first derivative of , when is increasing, must be positive.    For the position function with velocity and acceleration ,   on an interval where is positive, is increasing .    on an interval where is negative, is decreasing .    on an interval where is zero, is constant .    on an interval where is positive, is increasing .    on an interval where is negative, is decreasing .    on an interval where is zero, is constant .    on an interval where is positive, is concave up .    on an interval where is negative, is concave down .    on an interval where is zero, is linear .          Exploring the context of position, velocity, and acceleration is an excellent way to understand how a function, its first derivative, and its second derivative are related to one another. In Activity , we can replace , , and with an arbitrary function and its derivatives and , and essentially all the same observations hold. In particular, note that the following are equivalent: on an interval where the graph of is concave up, is increasing and is positive. Likewise, on an interval where the graph of is concave down, is decreasing and is negative.    A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time is measured in minutes. In Activity , we computed approximations to and using central differences. Those values are provided in the second table below, along with several others computed in the same way.    Select values of .                                      Select values of .         NA                         NA         What are the units on the values of ?    Use a central difference to estimate the value of .    What is the meaning of the value of that you have computed in (b) in terms of the potato's temperature? Write several careful sentences that discuss, with appropriate units, the values of , , and , and explain the overall behavior of the potato's temperature at this point in time.    Overall, is the potato's temperature increasing at an increasing rate, increasing at a constant rate, or increasing at a decreasing rate? Why?          Remember that the derivative's units are units of output per unit of input.     To estimate , we can use for an appropriate choice of .    For each of the values and , think about what they tell you about expected upcoming behavior in and , respectively.    Think concavity.          Degrees Fahrenheit per minute.     .    At the moment , the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees; its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute; and the rate at which the temperature is rising is falling at a rate of 0.119 degrees per minute per minute.    Increasing at a decreasing rate.           has units measured in degrees Fahrenheit per minute.    Using a central difference, .    The value , which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment , the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is falling at a rate of 0.119 degrees per minute per minute. That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate. At , we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.    The potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of are falling. Equivalently, this is because the value of is negative throughout the given time interval.         This activity builds on our experience and understanding of how to sketch the graph of given the graph of .  In Figure , given the respective graphs of two different functions , sketch the corresponding graph of on the first axes below, and then sketch on the second set of axes. In addition, for each, write several careful sentences in the spirit of those in Activity that connect the behaviors of , , and . For instance, write something such as    is on the interval , which is connected to the fact that is on the same interval , and is on the interval.   but of course with the blanks filled in. Throughout, view the scale of the grid for the graph of as being , and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of is identical to that for . If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of or , you should label that accordingly.   Two given functions , with axes provided for plotting and below.      Remember that to plot , it is helpful to first identify where .         The graphs of and are plotted below.         Summary     A differentiable function is increasing on an interval whenever its first derivative is positive, and decreasing whenever its first derivative is negative.    By taking the derivative of the derivative of a function , we arrive at the second derivative, . The second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the first derivative. The sign of the second derivative tells us whether the slope of the tangent line to is increasing or decreasing.    A differentiable function is concave up whenever its first derivative is increasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is positive), and concave down whenever its first derivative is decreasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is negative). Examples of functions that are everywhere concave up are and ; examples of functions that are everywhere concave down are and .    The units on the second derivative are units of output per unit of input per unit of input. They tell us how the value of the derivative function is changing in response to changes in the input. In other words, the second derivative tells us the rate of change of the rate of change of the original function.       Comparing values   Consider the function graphed below.   For this function, are the following nonzero quantities positive or negative?  is   positive    negative    is   positive    negative    is   positive    negative    (Because this is a multiple choice problem, it will not show which parts of the problem are correct or incorrect when you submit it.)                  -axis at , the value of is positive.

The sign of is determined by the slope of the function at the point: if the function is increasing, then ; if it is decreasing, , and if it is neither increasing nor decreasing, then . Similarly, the sign of is determined by the concavity of the function: if the function is concave up, then , if it is concave down, .

Its velocity is given in the following table, converted from miles per hour to feet per second, so that all time measurements are in seconds. (Note: 1 mph is 22\/15 ft\/sec.) Find the average acceleration of the car over each of the first two seconds.

What does each of the following statements tell us about the signs of the first and second derivatives of ?  (a) The price of the stock is rising faster and faster.  The first derivative of is   positive    zero    negative    The second derivative of is   positive    zero    negative    (b) The price of the stock is close to bottoming out.  The first derivative of is   positive    zero    negative    The second derivative of is   positive    zero    negative                         (a) This indicates that is positive and is positive.

Since is everywhere positive, is everywhere increasing. Hence the greatest value of is at x6 and the least value of is at x1. C,D. Directly from the graph, we see that is greatest at x4 and least at x2. E,F. Since gives the slope of the graph of , is greatest where is rising most rapidly, namely at x3, and is least where is falling most rapidly, namely at x1.       Suppose that is a twice-differentiable function such that is continuous for which the following information is known: , , .   Is increasing or decreasing near ? Is concave up or concave down near ?    Do you expect to be greater than , equal to , or less than ? Why?    Do you expect to be greater than , equal to , or less than ? Why?    Sketch a graph of near and include a graph of the tangent line.          is increasing and concave down near .    Greater.    Less.              Since is positive, is increasing near , and since is negative, is concave down near .    We are given that . Since is increasing at , we expect to be greater than .    Since is negative, we also know that is decreasing near . Thus, we expect that will be less than .    In the following figure, we see a possible graph of a function that passes through the point at an instantaneous rate of and in such a way that its second derivative at is negative.          For a certain function , its derivative is given by the function pictured in Figure .   The graph of .       What is the approximate slope of the tangent line to at the point ?    How many real number solutions can there be to the equation ? Justify your conclusion fully and carefully by explaining what you know about how the graph of must behave based on the given graph of .    On the interval , how many times does the concavity of change? Why?    Use the provided graph to estimate the value of .          .    At most one.     .     .         From the given graph of , we may estimate that .    Observe that is always positive. This tells us that must be always increasing. Therefore, it follows that may cross the -axis at most one time, and hence there can be at most one solution to .    On , changes concavity times, since changes from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing times. Whenever is increasing, is positive, and whenever is decreasing, is negative. Hence, whenever changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it follows that changes sign, and this causes a change in the concavity of . We therefore see that while is always increasing, changes concavity many times.    From the given graph of , we can see that and . Using a central difference, it follows that .       A bungee jumper's height (in feet ) at time (in seconds) is given in part by the table:                                                                     Use the given data to estimate , , and . At which of these times is the bungee jumper rising most rapidly?    Use the given data and your work in (a) to estimate .    What physical property of the bungee jumper does the value of measure? What are its units?    Based on the data, on what approximate time intervals is the function concave down? What is happening to the velocity of the bungee jumper on these time intervals?          ; ; ; rising most rapidly at .     .    Acceleration of the bungee jumper in feet per second per second.     , .         We will use central differences to estimate the requested derivatives. Thus, The bungee jumper is rising most rapidly at , at a rate of about feet per second.    We again use a central difference, this time to estimate . Observe that      measures the acceleration of the bungee jumper at . Thus we know that the person's acceleration at is about feet per second per second. This measures the instantaneous rate of change of the jumper's velocity.    The bungee jumper's position function is concave down on approximately the intervals , . This is easiest to see if we plot the data using a program like Excel. On these time intervals, the velocity of the jumper is decreasing: either the velocity is positive and getting less positive, or negative and getting more negative.

When a function is increasing, its graph rises as increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of an increasing, concave up function on the interval is shown in the following figure. When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl.

  "body": " Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability     What does it mean graphically to say that has limit as ? How is this connected to having a left-hand limit at and having a right-hand limit at ?    What does it mean to say that a function is continuous at ? What role do limits play in determining whether or not a function is continuous at a point?    What does it mean graphically to say that a function is differentiable at ? How is this connected to the function being locally linear?    How are the characteristics of a function having a limit, being continuous, and being differentiable at a given point related to one another?      In Section , we learned how limits can be used to study the trend of a function near a fixed input value. In this section, we aim to quantify how the function acts and how its values change near a particular point. If the function has a limit at , we will consider how the value of the function is related to , and whether or not the function has a derivative at .   A function is given by the graph in Figure . Use the graph to answer each of the following questions. Note: to the right of , the graph of is exhibiting infinite oscillatory behavior similar to the function that we encountered in the key example early in Section . Assume that .     For each of the values , determine whether or not exists. If the function has a limit at a given point, state the value of the limit using the notation . If the function does not have a limit at a given point, write a sentence to explain why.    For each of the values of from part (a) where has a limit, determine the value of at each such point. In addition, for each such value, does have the same value as ?    For each of the values , determine whether or not exists. In particular, based on the given graph, ask yourself if it is reasonable to say that has a tangent line at for each of the given -values. If so, visually estimate the slope of the tangent line to find the value of .      The graph of .       Having a limit at a point  In Section , we learned that has limit as approaches provided that we can make the value of as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal to) . If so, we write .  Essentially there are two behaviors that a function can exhibit near a point where it fails to have a limit. In Figure , at left we see a function whose graph shows a jump at . If we let approach 1 from the left side, the value of approaches 2, but if we let approach from the right, the value of tends to 3. Because the value of does not approach a single number as gets arbitrarily close to 1 from both sides, we know that does not have a limit at .  For such cases, we introduce the notion of left and right (or one-sided ) limits. left limit  right limit  limit one-sided     We say that has limit as approaches from the left and write provided that we can make the value of as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close to while always having . We call the left-hand limit of as approaches . Similarly, we say is the right-hand limit of as approaches and write provided that we can make the value of as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close to while always having .    In the graph of the function in Figure , we see that . Precisely because the left and right limits are not equal, the overall limit of as fails to exist.   Functions and that each fail to have a limit at .    For the function pictured at right in Figure , the function fails to have a limit at for a different reason. While the function does not have a jump in its graph at , it is still not the case that approaches a single value as approaches 1. In particular, due to the infinitely oscillating behavior of to the right of , we say that the right-hand limit of as does not exist, and thus .  To summarize, if either a left- or right-hand limit fails to exist or if the left- and right-hand limits are not equal to each other, the overall limit does not exist.   A function has limit as if and only if .   That is, a function has a limit at if and only if both the left- and right-hand limits at exist and have the same value.  In Preview Activity , the function given in Figure fails to have a limit at only two values: at (where the left- and right-hand limits are 2 and , respectively) and at , where does not exist). Note well that even at values such as and where there are holes in the graph, the limit still exists.    Consider a function that is piecewise-defined according to the formula   Use the given formula to answer the following questions.   Axes for plotting the function in Activity .       For each of the values , compute .    For each of the values , determine and .    For each of the values , determine . If the limit fails to exist, explain why by discussing the left- and right-hand limits at the relevant -value.    For which values of is the following statement true?     On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate, labeled graph of . Be sure to carefully use open circles (○) and filled circles (●) to represent key points on the graph, as dictated by the piecewise formula.          Find the interval in which lies and evaluate the function there.    Remember that for , we only consider values of such that . Find the right formula to use in the piecewise definition for to fit the values you are considering.    Use your work in (c) and compare left- and right-hand limits.    Use your work in (a) and (c).    Note that is piecewise linear.           ; is not defined; ; ; .              does not exist. The values of the limits as for are .     , , and .                ; is not defined; ; (by the rule); .              does not exists because the left-hand limit is while the right-hand limit is . All of the other requested limits exist, as left- and right-hand limits exist and are equal in each case. The respective values of the limits as for are .    For , , and , . At , the limit fails to exist, but . At , the limit is , but is not defined. At , the limit is 3, but .              Being continuous at a point  continuous  Intuitively, a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page. Alternatively, we might say that the graph of a continuous function has no jumps or holes in it. In Figure we consider three functions that have a limit at , and use them to make the idea of continuity more precise.   Functions , , and that demonstrate subtly different behaviors at .    First consider the function in the left-most graph. Note that is not defined, which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of at . We will naturally say that is not continuous at . For the function , we observe that while , the value of , and thus the limit does not equal the function value. Here, too, we will say that is not continuous , even though the function is defined at . Finally, the function appears to be the most well-behaved of all three, since at its limit and its function value agree. That is, .  With no hole or jump in the graph of at , we say that is continuous there. More formally, we make the following definition.    A function is continuous at  continuous at provided that    has a limit as ,     is defined at , and     .       Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c), but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance. The definition says that a function is continuous at provided that its limit as exists and equals its function value at . If a function is continuous at every point in an interval , we say the function is continuous on . If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, we simply say the function is continuous. Thus, continuous functions are particularly nice: to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point, all we need to do is evaluate the function.  For example, consider . It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number, and thus if we would like to know , we simply compute .  This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works whenever we know that the function being considered is continuous. Besides polynomial functions, all exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions are continuous at every point, as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.    This activity builds on your work in Preview Activity , using the same function as given by the graph that is repeated in Figure . Assume that .   The graph of for Activity .       At which values of does not exist?    At which values of is not defined?    At which values of does have a limit, but ?    State all values of for which is not continuous at .    Which condition is stronger, and hence implies the other: has a limit at or is continuous at ? Explain, and hence complete the following sentence: If  at , then  at , where you complete the blanks with has a limit and is continuous , using each phrase once.          Consider the left- and right-hand limits at each value.    Carefully examine places on the graph where there's an open circle.    Are there locations on the graph where the function has a limit but there's a hole in the graph?    Remember that at least one of three conditions must fail: if the function lacks a limit, if the function is undefined, or if the limit exists but does not equal the function value, then is not continuous at the point.    Note that the definition of being continuous requires the limit to exist.           ; .     .     ; .     ; ; ; .     If  is continuous at , then  has a limit at .            does not exist at since and does not exist at since does not exist due to the infinitely oscillatory behavior of .    The only point at which is not defined is at .    At , note that exists (and appears to have value approximately ), but , and thus . At , , but is not defined, so the limit exists but does not equal the function value.    Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c), is not continuous at and because does not have a limit at those points; is not continuous at since is not defined there; and is not continuous at because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.     If  is continuous at , then  has a limit at , since one of the defining properties of being continuous at is that the function has a limit at that input value. This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.         Being differentiable at a point  differentiable  We recall that a function is said to be differentiable at if exists. Moreover, for to exist, we know that the function must have a tangent line at the point , since is precisely the slope of this line. In order to even ask if has a tangent line at , it is necessary that be continuous at : if fails to have a limit at , if is not defined, or if does not equal the value of , then it doesn't make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.  Indeed, it can be proved formally that if a function is differentiable at , then it must be continuous at . So, if is not continuous at , then it is automatically the case that is not differentiable there. For example, in Figure , both and fail to be differentiable at because neither function is continuous at . But can a function fail to be differentiable at a point where the function is continuous?  In Figure , the function has a sharp corner at a point. For the pictured function , we observe that is clearly continuous at , since .   A function that is continuous at but not differentiable at ; at right, we zoom in on the point in a magnified version of the box in the left-hand plot.    But the function in Figure is not differentiable at because fails to exist. One way to see this is to observe that for every value of that is less than 1, while for every value of that is greater than 1. That makes it seem that either or would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at . Alternately, we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute , and discover that the derivative does not exist. Finally, we can see visually that the function in Figure does not have a tangent line. When we zoom in on on the graph of , no matter how closely we examine the function, it will always look like a V , and never like a single line, which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.  If a function does have a tangent line at a given point, when we zoom in on the point of tangency, the function and the tangent line should appear essentially indistinguishable See, for instance, this applet , where zooming in shows the increasing similarity between the tangent line and the curve. . Conversely, if we zoom in on a point and the function looks like a single straight line, then the function should have a tangent line there, and thus be differentiable. Hence, a function that is differentiable at will, up close, look more and more like its tangent line at . Therefore, we say that a function that is differentiable at is locally linear . locally linear   To summarize the preceding discussion of differentiability and continuity, we make several important observations.      If is differentiable at , then is continuous at . Equivalently, if fails to be continuous at , then will not be differentiable at .    A function can be continuous at a point, but not be differentiable there. In particular, a function is not differentiable at if the graph has a sharp corner (or cusp ) cusp at the point .    If is differentiable at , then is locally linear at . That is, when a function is differentiable, it looks linear when viewed up close because it resembles its tangent line there.        In this activity, we explore two different functions and classify the points at which each is not differentiable. Let be the function given by the rule , and let be the function that we have previously explored in Preview Activity , whose graph is given again in Figure .   The graph of for Activity .       Reasoning visually, explain why is differentiable at every point such that .    Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that .    Explain why fails to exist by using small positive and negative values of .    State all values of for which is not differentiable at . For each, provide a reason for your conclusion.

You might start by identifying points where is not continuous.    What does being differentiable at a point tell you about continuity there?           is piecewise linear.          , but .     .    True.          We know that is given by the formula when and by when . Each of these pieces of is a straight line, so at every point other than the point where they meet, the function has a well-defined slope, and thus is differentiable.    Observe that     Following up on our work in (b), note that whenever , , and thus , while whenever , , and thus Since the right- and left-hand limits are not equal, it follows that does not exist.     is not differentiable at because at each of these points is not continuous. In addition, is not differentiable at and because the graph of has a corner point (or cusp) at each of these values.    True: if a function is differentiable at , then must exist. This is true because we know that if is differentiable at a point, then is continuous there, and anytime a function is continuous at a point, it must have a limit there.         Summary     A function has limit as if and only if has a left-hand limit at , has a right-hand limit at , and the left- and right-hand limits are equal. Visually, this means that there can be a hole in the graph at , but the function must approach the same single value from either side of .    A function is continuous at whenever is defined, has a limit as , and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree. This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of at .    A function is differentiable at whenever exists, which means that has a tangent line at and thus is locally linear at . Informally, this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at and that there is not a corner point or cusp at .    Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at , being continuous at , and being differentiable at ), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if is differentiable at , then is also continuous at , and if is continuous at , then has a limit at .       Limit values of a piecewise graph   Use the figure below, which gives a graph of the function , to give values for the indicated limits. If a limit does not exist, enter none .   (a)  =  help (limits)  (b)  =  (c)  =  (d)  =                       (a) As approaches from either side, the values of get closer and closer to , so the limit appears to be about . (b) As approaches 0 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to . (Recall that to find a limit, we are interested in what happens to the function near but not at .) The limit appears to be about . (c) As approaches 1 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to on one side of and get closer and closer to on the other side of . Thus the limit does not exist. (d) As approaches 4 from either side, the values of get closer and closer to 17. (Again, recall that we don't care what happens right at .) The limit appears to be about 17.      Limit values of a piecewise formula   For the function use algebra to find each of the following limits:        (For each, enter DNE if the limit does not exist.)  Sketch a graph of to confirm your answers.                  is shown below. From this, and from the given formula for , we can see that , and . These are the same value, so we know that the limit must exist: . Note, however, that is not continuous at since .      Continuity and differentiability of a graph   Consider the function graphed below.   At what -values does the function appear to not be continuous?   At what -values does the function appear to not be differentiable?   (Enter none if there are no -values that apply; enter -values as a comma-separated list, e.g., 1,3,5 .)             -values shown except for . The function appears to be non-differentiable at the -values . (Recall that a function is non-differentiable where it has breaks, sharp corners or vertical tangents.)      Continuity of a piecewise formula   Find so that the following function is continuous:          , the function is continuous at every point except . We choose to make the function continuous at . Since takes the value at , we choose so that goes through the point . Thus .         Consider the graph of the function that is provided in Figure . Assume that each portion of the graph of is a straight line, as pictured.   At left, the piecewise linear function . At right, axes for plotting .       State all values of for which does not exist.    State all values of for which is not continuous at .    State all values of for which is not differentiable at .    On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate graph of .          .     .     .              The only value of at which does not exist is . This is because .     is not continuous at because does not exist. In addition, is not continuous at because is not defined.     is not differentiable at and at since is not continuous at these points. In addition, is not differentiable at since has corner points at these values, making not have a tangent line at these values.    Note that is piecewise linear, so the value of the derivative of (where it exists) is the slope of , which will be constant on each interval where is linear. In addition, note that is not defined at , which is reflected by open circles in the following plot.          For each of the following prompts, give an example of a function that satisfies the stated criteria. A formula or a graph, with reasoning, is sufficient for each. If no such example is possible, explain why.   A function that is continuous at but not differentiable at .    A function that is differentiable at but does not have a limit at .

In particular, must be piecewise linear with slope of or , depending on the interval.     is not defined for , as reflected by the open circles on the graph of .    It is possible that is not continuous at , since is not differentiable at these points; everywhere else, must be continuous.    There are many different possible graphs for . Two of them are shown in the following figure. The blue graph is one possible version of that is continuous. Note that we can vertically shift that graph and its derivative will still be the given . Moreover, we can vertically shift any of the piecewise linear portions of to generate a graph such as the one shown in red, which also has derivative .          Consider the function .

  "title": "The Tangent Line Approximation",
  "body": " The Tangent Line Approximation     What is the formula for the general tangent line approximation to a differentiable function at the point ?    What is the principle of local linearity and what is the local linearization of a differentiable function at a point ?    How does knowing just the tangent line approximation tell us information about the behavior of the original function itself near the point of approximation? How does knowing the second derivative's value at this point provide us additional knowledge of the original function's behavior?      Among all functions, linear functions are simplest. One of the powerful consequences of a function being differentiable at a point is that, up close, the function is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point. In certain circumstances, this allows us to approximate the original function with a simpler function that is linear: this can be advantageous when we have limited information about or when is computationally or algebraically complicated. We will explore all of these situations in what follows.  It is essential to recall that when is differentiable at , the value of provides the slope of the tangent line to at the point . If we know both a point on the line and the slope of the line we can find the equation of the tangent line and write the equation in point-slope form Recall that a line with slope that passes through has equation , and this is the point-slope form of the equation. .   Consider the function .     Use the limit definition of the derivative to compute a formula for .    Determine the slope of the tangent line to at the value .    Compute .    Find an equation for the tangent line to at the point . Write your result in point-slope form.    On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate, labeled graph of along with its tangent line at the point .      Axes for plotting and its tangent line to the point .       The tangent line  tangent line equation  Given a function that is differentiable at , we know that we can determine the slope of the tangent line to at by computing . The equation of the resulting tangent line is given in point-slope form by . Note well: there is a major difference between and in this context. The former is a constant that results from using the given fixed value of , while the latter is the general expression for the rule that defines the function. The same is true for and : we must carefully distinguish between these expressions. Each time we find the tangent line, we need to evaluate the function and its derivative at a fixed -value.  In Figure , we see the graph of a function and its tangent line at the point . Notice how when we zoom in we see the local linearity of more clearly highlighted. The function and its tangent line are nearly indistinguishable up close. Local linearity can also be seen dynamically in this applet .   A function and its tangent line at the point : at left, from a distance, and at right, up close. At right, we label the tangent line function by and observe that for near , .      The local linearization  local linearization  A slight change in perspective and notation will enable us to be more precise in discussing how the tangent line approximates near . By solving for , we can write the equation for the tangent line as This line is itself a function of . Replacing the variable with the expression , we call the local linearization of at the point . In this notation, is nothing more than a new name for the tangent line. As we saw above, for close to , .    Suppose that a function has its tangent line approximation given by at the point , but we do not know anything else about the function . To estimate a value of for near 1, such as , we can use the fact that and hence .    We emphasize that is simply a new name for the tangent line function. Using this new notation and our observation that for near , it follows that we can write .    Suppose it is known that for a given differentiable function , its local linearization at the point where is given by .   Compute the values of and .    What must be the values of and ? Why?    Do you expect the value of to be greater than or less than the value of ? Why?    Use the local linearization to estimate the value of .    Suppose that you also know that . What does this tell you about the graph of at ?    For near , sketch the graph of the local linearization as well as a possible graph of on the axes provided in Figure .      Axes for plotting and .         Follow the rule for .    Recall that the form of the local linearization is .    Is the function increasing or decreasing at ?    Remember that .    What does the second derivative tell you about the shape of a curve?    Use your work above.           ; .     ; .    Less.     .    Concave up.    The illustration below shows a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through .             Using the formula for , ; Since , we see .    Since , we see and . Alternatively, we could observe that the value and slope of must match the value and slope of at the point of tangency.    Because , we see that is increasing near , and therefore is expected to be less than .    Observe that .    Since , we know is concave up at .    In the figure below, we use the results of our previous work to generate the plot shown, which is a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through .          From Activity , we see that the local linearization is a linear function that shares two important values with the function that it is derived from. In particular,  because , it follows that ; and  because is a linear function, its derivative is its slope.  Hence, for every value of , and specifically . Therefore, we see that is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function at the point .  Thus, if we know the linear approximation for a function, we know the original function's value and its slope at the point of tangency. What remains unknown, however, is the shape of the function at the point of tangency. There are essentially four possibilities, as shown in Figure .   Four possible graphs for a nonlinear differentiable function and how it can be situated relative to its tangent line at a point.    These possible shapes result from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative: either , , or .  If , then we know the graph of is concave up, and we see the first possibility on the left, where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve.  If , then is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve, as shown in the second figure.  If and changes sign at , the concavity of the graph will change, and we will see either the third or fourth figure. It is possible that but does not change sign at , in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options. .  A fifth option (which is not very interesting) can occur if the function itself is linear, so that for all values of .    The plots in Figure highlight yet another important thing that we can learn from the concavity of the graph near the point of tangency: whether the tangent line lies above or below the curve itself. This is key because it tells us whether or not the tangent line approximation's values will be too large or too small in comparison to the true value of . For instance, in the first situation in the leftmost plot in Figure where , because the tangent line falls below the curve, we know that for all values of near .    This activity concerns a function about which the following information is known:    is a differentiable function defined at every real number           has its graph given in Figure       At center, a graph of ; at left, axes for plotting ; at right, axes for plotting .

See the image in part .    The slope of the tangent line to is increasing for because is an increasing function on this interval. Similarly, for , the slope of the tangent line to is decreasing. Right at , the slope of the tangent line to is neither increasing nor decreasing.    See the plot in the image below, which shows, at left, a possible graph of near , along with the tangent line through . Note that is concave up for since is increasing on that interval, and is concave down for since is decreasing there. Hence changes from concave up to concave down right at , which is also the point near 2 where the graph of is steepest.        Because the tangent line to lies above the graph of to the right of , our estimate of is too large the local linearization overshoots the true value of at this point.       The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that finds wide application in calculus. For example, by approximating a function with its local linearization, it is possible to develop an effective algorithm to estimate the zeroes of a function. Local linearity also helps us to make further sense of certain challenging limits. For instance, we have seen that the limit is indeterminate, because both its numerator and denominator tend to 0. While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify , it is straightforward to show that the linearization of at the point is given by . Hence, for values of near 0, , and therefore , which makes plausible the fact that .    Summary     The tangent line to a differentiable function at the point is given in point-slope form by the equation .    The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function is differentiable, the function will be indistinguishable from its tangent line. That is, a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close. We rename the tangent line to be the function , where . Thus, for all near .    If we know the tangent line approximation to a function , then because and , we also know the values of both the function and its derivative at the point where . In other words, the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function. If, in addition, we know the value of , we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of , depending on the concavity of .         Approximating   Use linear approximation to approximate as follows.  Let . The equation of the tangent line to at can be written in the form . Compute and .      Using this find the approximation for .  Answer:                        Local linearization of a graph   The figure below shows and its local linearization at , . (The local linearization is shown in blue.)   What is the value of ?    What is the value of ?    Use the linearization to approximate the value of .    Is the approximation an under- or overestimate?  (Enter under or over .)                       , we have . Since the point with lies on both the line and the curve, we have The approximation is an underestimate because the line lies under the curve. Since the linear function approximates , we have       Estimating with the local linearization   Suppose that is a function with and . Estimate .          and tell us that at , the value of the function is 40 and the function is increasing at a rate of 2 units for a unit increase in . Since we increase by 4.5 units in going from 90 to 94.5, the value of the function goes up by approximately units, so       Predicting behavior from the local linearization   The temperature, , in degrees Celsius, of a cup of coffee placed on the kitchen counter is given by , where is in minutes since the coffee was put on the counter.

At minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its   derivative    temperature    change in temperature   is and will   increase    decrease   by about in the next 60 seconds.  Note: If you are using MathQuill click the textbox (Tt) button before entering an answer that contains units.                                      (a) As the cup of coffee cools, the temperature decreases, so is negative. (b) Since , the units are degrees Celsius per minute (degC\/min). The quantity represents the rate at which the coffee is cooling, in degrees per minute, 10 minutes after the cup is put on the counter. Thus we can complete the statement: At 10 minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its temperature is 77 degC and will decrease by about 1.2 degC in the next 60 seconds.       A certain function has its local linearization at given by .   What are the values of and ? Why?    Estimate the value of .    Suppose that and you know that for . Is your estimate in (b) too large or too small?    Suppose that for . Use this fact and the additional information above to sketch an accurate graph of near . Include a sketch of in your work.          and .     .    Too large.              Since the value and slope of the tangent line match the value and slope of the function at the point of tangency, we know and .    Using the local linearization, .    Since for , we know that is concave down for . This means to the left of the point of tangency at , the tangent line lies above the curve, and thus the estimate in (b) is too large.    In the following figure, we see a possible function that matches the value and slope of the tangent line at the point and that is concave down to the left of and concave up to the right.          A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time is measured in minutes.   Temperature data for the potato.                                        Use a central difference to estimate . Use this estimate as needed in subsequent questions.    Find the local linearization to the function at the point where .    Determine an estimate for by employing the local linearization.    Do you think your estimate in (c) is too large or too small? Why?          degrees per minute.     .     degrees F.    Overestimate.         The central difference approximation with gives degrees per minute.    The local linearization at is .    Using the linearization from (b), degrees F.    Since the values of given in the table appear to be increasing at a decreasing rate, it follows that the graph of is concave down. This implies that near , the graph of (the tangent line to at lies above the graph of . Therefore, the approximation given in part (c) is probably an overestimate.       An object moving along a straight line path has a differentiable position function ; measures the object's position relative to the origin at time . It is known that at time seconds, the object's position is feet (i.e., 4 feet to the right of the origin). Furthermore, the object's instantaneous velocity at is feet per second, and its acceleration at the same instant is feet per second per second.   Use local linearity to estimate the position of the object at .    Is your estimate likely too large or too small? Why?    In everyday language, describe the behavior of the moving object at . Is it moving toward the origin or away from it? Is its velocity increasing or decreasing?          .    underestimate.    The object is slowing down as it moves toward toward its starting position at .         The linearization of at is . With the information we have we can find the linearization of at , using the facts that and . Thus, the linearization of at is . One use of the linearization is that for close to , can provide a good approximation to . So .    Since is positive, we know that the graph of is concave up at . This means that the linearization of at lies below the graph of and so is an underestimate to .    Given that is negative, the object is moving back toward its original position. The fact that is positive means that the velocity of the object is increasing at . This means that the object is actually slowing down as it moves toward toward its starting position at .       For a certain function , its derivative is known to be . Note that you do not know a formula for .   At what -value(s) is ? Justify your answer algebraically, but include a graph of to support your conclusion.    Reasoning graphically, for what intervals of -values is ?

This is confirmed by plotting where we only see the graph cross the -axis at (though we do see the graph approach the -axis) as increases or decreases without bound).    We know that wherever is increasing. From the graph of , we see that is increasing approximately on the interval , and thus is concave up on this interval.    The tangent line approximation at is . Thus, . Since at and around , is concave down there, and therefore the tangent line lies above the curve. This makes our estimate larger than the true value of .       "
