            The graph of the curve fails the vertical line test.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because the graph of the curve fails the vertical line test,
            <m>y</m> cannot be a function of <m>x</m>.
            This also confirms our intuition that there is not an algebraic means by which we can rearrange the equation
            <m>x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y</m> to write <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            We differentiate implicitly,
            taking the derivative of each side with respect to <m>x</m>,
            <me>
              \frac{d}{dx}[x ]= \frac{d}{dx}[y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y]
            </me>,
            and evaluate the elementary derivative on the left and use the sum rule on the right to find that
            <me>
              1 = \frac{d}{dx}[y^5] - \frac{d}{dx}[5y^3] + \frac{d}{dx}[4y]
            </me>.
            By the chain and constant multiple rules,
            viewing <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, we now have
            <me>
              1 = 5y^4\frac{dy}{dx} - 15y^2\frac{dy}{dx} + 4\frac{dy}{dx}
            </me>.
            Factoring,
            <me>
              1 = \frac{dy}{dx}(5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4)
            </me>,
            and therefore
            <me>
              \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4}

            To find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of
            <m>x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y</m> at the point <m>(0, 1)</m>,
            we only need the slope of the tangent line.
            Hence we compute
            <me>
              \left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(0,1)} = \frac{1}{5 \cdot 1^4 - 15 \cdot 1^2 + 4} = -\frac{1}{6}
            </me>.
            Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is
            <me>
              y - 1 = -\frac{1}{6}(x-0)
            </me>

            <m>(1.418697,0.543912)</m>,
            <m>(-1.418697,-0.543912)</m>,

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since a line is vertical whenever its slope is undefined,
            we seek all points <m>(x,y)</m> that make <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> undefined.
            This will occur precisely when the denominator,
            <m>5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4</m>, is zero.
            Using a graphing utility or computer algebra system to solve the equation <m>5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4 = 0</m>,
            we find that this happens at the four approximate <m>y</m>-values <m>y \approx \pm 0.543912, \pm 1.64443</m>.
            For each such value, we use the original equation
            <m>x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y</m> to find the <m>x</m>-value of the point.
            Doing so,
            we have established that there are four points at which the tangent line is vertical,
            and they are approximately <m>(1.418697,0.543912)</m>,
            <m>(-1.418697,-0.543912)</m>,
            <m>(-3.63143, 1.64443)</m>,
            and <m>(3.63143, -1.64443)</m>.
