    <introduction>
      <p> 
      In each of the following contexts, explain the meaning of the given derivative values in two ways that are similar to the sentence structures and discussions of units in <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-1-pop-growth">Example</xref> and <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-2-time-speed">Example</xref>.  
    </p>
      <p>  
      First, write a sentence that explicitly describes what we know about the instantaneous rate of change of the given function at a particular instant, with units.  Then, write a second sentence that explains the amount of change we expect in the function value if the input variable changes by one unit at the known instant.  
    </p>
      <p>
      Remember not to try to simplify the units on the derivative value, but rather keep the units in the form <q>units of output per unit of input</q>.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m>V(m)</m> measures the value of a car (in dollars) after the car has been driven <m>m</m> miles.  Explain the meaning of the statement <me>V'(10250) = -0.89</me> by writing two sentences that address the instantaneous rate of change and the predicted change in the function, respectively.  
          </p>
        <p>
            Explicitly, your first sentence might have structure like
        </p>
            <blockquote><p><m>V'(10250) = -0.89</m> means that the instantaneous rate of change of <fillin characters="5"/> when the car has been driven <fillin characters="10"/> miles is <m>-0.89</m><fillin characters="15"/>,
              </p></blockquote>
              <p>
            where the final blank should be completed using the units on the derivative.  Your second sentence might have form
              </p>
            <blockquote><p>
                When the car has been driven <fillin characters="10"/> miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will <fillin characters="10"/> by about <m>-0.89</m><fillin characters="10"/>.
