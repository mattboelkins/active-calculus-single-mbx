  <statement>
     <p> In each of the following contexts, explain the meaning of the given derivative values in two ways.  First, write 
        a sentence that explicitly describes what we know the instantaneous rate of change of the given function
        at a particular instant, with units.  
        Then, write a second sentence that explains the amount of change we expect in the function value if the
        input variable changes by one unit at the known instant.  
        Compare the sentence structure and discussion of units in <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-1-pop-growth">Example</xref> and 
        <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-2-time-speed">Example</xref>.
