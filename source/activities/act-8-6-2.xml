    <introduction>
      <p>
      In this activity we apply the Lagrange Error Bound to quantify the accuracy of several different approximations.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Use the degree <m>10</m> Taylor polynomial (centered at <m>a = 0</m>) of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> to estimate the value of <m>e^2</m>.  What is the maximum error of your estimate, according to the Lagrange Error Bound?  How does this compare to the actual error between <m>e^2</m> and <m>T_{10}(2)</m> as reported by a computer algebra system?

        <p>
          Recall that for <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, its Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> is given by 
          <me>
            \ln(1+x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}\frac{1}{n}x^n + \cdots

          and that the <m>n^{\text{th}}</m> derivative of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> is given by

            f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^{n-1}(n-1)!}{(1+x)^n}

          If we want to estimate <m>f(0.5) = \ln(1.5)</m> to within an accuracy of <m>0.0001</m>, what value of <m>n</m> is needed to achieve this accuracy from computing <m>T_n(0.5)</m>, according to the Lagrange Error Bound?
