            Using the central difference, we find that

              F'(20) \approx \frac{F(30)-F(10)}{30-10} = \frac{167.6-94.7}{20} = 3.645

            As time goes on, we see that itâ€™s usually the case that the amount of increase in the potato's temperature gets less and less, thus we expect the value of <m>F'(t)</m> to get smaller and smaller as time goes on. We therefore expect <m>F'(50) \gt F'(60)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The value <m>F(46) = 192.5</m> is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 46, while <m>F'(46) = 1.3941</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant <m>t = 46</m>,
            and its units are degrees per minute. Because at time <m>t = 46</m> the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.3941 degrees per minute, we expect that at <m>t = 47</m>, the temperature will be about 1.3941 degrees greater than at <m>t = 46</m>,
            or in other words <m>F(47) \approx 192.5 + 1.3941 = 193.8941</m>. Similarly, at <m>t = 48</m>, two minutes have elapsed from <m>t = 48</m>, so we expect an increase of <m>2 \cdot 1.3941</m> degrees: <m>F(48) \approx 192.5 + 2 \cdot 1.3941 = 195.2882</m>.

          <p>
            Throughout the time interval <m>[10,40]</m>, the temperature <m>F</m> of the potato is increasing.  But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing. That is, while the values of <m>F</m> continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of <m>F'</m> seem to be getting smaller (while still remaining positive).  We thus might say that on the interval <m>[10,40]</m> <q>the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.</q>
