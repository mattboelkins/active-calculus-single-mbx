    <introduction>
      <p> 
      In each of the following contexts, explain the meaning of the given derivative values in two ways that are similar to the sentence structures and discussions of units in <!-- <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-1-pop-growth">Example</xref> and <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-2-time-speed">Example</xref>--> the two examples preceding this activity in the text.  
    </p>
      <p>  
        First, write a sentence that explicitly describes what we know about the instantaneous rate of change of the given function at a particular instant, with units.  Then, write a second sentence that explains the amount of change we expect in the function value if the input variable changes by one unit at the known instant.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Remember not to try to simplify the units on the derivative value, but rather keep the units in the form <q>units of output per unit of input</q>.

            Suppose that <m>V(m)</m> measures the value of a car (in dollars) after the car has been driven <m>m</m> miles.  Explain the meaning of the statement <me>V'(10250) = -0.89</me> by writing two sentences that address the instantaneous rate of change and the predicted change in the function, respectively.  
          </p>
        <p>
            Explicitly, your first sentence might have structure like
        </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><m>V'(10250) = -0.89</m> means that the instantaneous rate of change of <fillin characters="5"/> when the car has been driven <fillin characters="10"/> miles is <m>-0.89</m><fillin characters="15"/>,
              </p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            where the final blank should be completed using the units on the derivative.  Your second sentence might have form
        </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                When the car has been driven <fillin characters="10"/> miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will <fillin characters="10"/> by about <m>0.89</m><fillin characters="10"/>.

      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>V'(10250) = -0.89</m> means that the instantaneous rate of change of the car's value when the car has been driven <m>10250</m> miles is <m>-0.89</m> dollars per mile. In addition, when the car has been driven <m>10250</m> miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will decrease by about <m>0.89</m> dollars.
        </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>V'(10250) = -0.89</m> means that the instantaneous rate of change of the car's value when the car has been driven <m>10250</m> miles is <m>-0.89</m> dollars per mile. This tells us that when the car has been driven <m>10250</m> miles, if the car is driven one more mile, we expect that the value of the car will decrease by about <m>0.89</m> dollars.
