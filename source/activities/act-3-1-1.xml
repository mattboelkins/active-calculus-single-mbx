  <introduction>
    <p>
      Suppose that <m>g(x)</m> is a function whose first derivative is 
      <me>
        g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-2)}{x^2+1}
      </me>.

    <statement>

        Determine, with justification, all critical numbers of <m>g</m>.

    </statement>
    <hint>
          <p>
            Where is <m>g'(x) = 0</m>?  Is there anywhere that <m>g'(x)</m> is undefined?
          </p>
    </hint>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>x = -4</m> and <m>x = 2</m> are the only two critical numbers of <m>g</m>.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the given fact that <m>g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-2)}{x^2+1}</m>, we observe that since <m>x^2 + 1</m> is never 0, <m>g'(x)</m> is never undefined.  Moreover, <m>g'(x) = 0</m> implies that <m>(x+4)(x-2) = 0</m>, which only happens when <m>x = -4</m> or <m>x = 2</m>, so these are the two critical numbers of <m>g</m>.

        By developing a carefully labeled first derivative sign chart,
        decide whether <m>g</m> has as a local maximum,

        or neither at each critical number.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Choose values of <m>x</m> that lie just before and/or just after each of the critical numbers, and find the sign of <m>g'(x)</m> at each of them.

        For <m>x \lt -4</m>, <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m>;  for <m>-4 \lt x \lt 2</m>, <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m>; and for <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m>.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We can observe that for <m>x \lt -4</m>, <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m>;  for <m>-4 \lt x \lt 2</m>, <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m>; and for <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m>.

        Are there <m>x</m>-values where <m>g'(x)</m> changes from negative to positive?  positive to negative?

    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m>; <m>g</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = 2</m>.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the First Derivative Test and the signs of <m>g'(x)</m> we found in (b), it follows <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m>, since at that value <m>g'(x)</m> changes from positive to negative; similarly, <m>g</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = 2</m> since there the derivative changes from negative to positive.

        By thinking about where <m>g</m> is increasing and decreasing, as well as where <m>g</m> has local extremes, we can sketch the following possible graph of <m>g</m>.

        <p>
          Note that any vertical shift of <m>g</m> will have the same shape and same derivative, so multiple graphs are possible.  In addition, we can observe that as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>, <m>g'(x) \to 1</m>, and this explains why our graph looks linear in its end behavior in each direction.
