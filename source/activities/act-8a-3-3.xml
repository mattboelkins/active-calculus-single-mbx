      <p>
      Consider the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>.  Find the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial approximation centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
            To begin finding <m>T_n(x)</m>, do the usual work of computing the various derivatives of <m>f</m> and their respective values at <m>a = 0</m>; note that it's helpful to view <m>f(x)</m> in the form <m>f(x) = (1-x)^{-1}</m> so that we can easily compute the derivatives of <m>f</m> using the chain rule.  For instance,
            <me>
              f'(x) = (-1)(1-x)^{-2}(-1)
            </me>
            where the first <q><m>-1</m></q> arises from the power rule, while the second <q><m>-1</m></q> results from the chain rule, since <m>\frac{d}{dx}[1-x] = -1</m>.  In order to see key patterns that arise, it's helpful not to combine the products of numbers that arise in the various derivatives.  Record the first five derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> in <xref ref="T-8a-3-act-3-geom">Table</xref>.

            The first five derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> are shown in <xref ref="T-8a-3-act-3-geom-soln">Table</xref>.

            Next, evaluate the derivatives you determined in (a) at <m>a = 0</m> and use these to find the values of the coefficients of the Taylor polynomial centered at <m>a = 0</m>.  Record your work in <xref ref="T-8a-3-act-3-geom-2">Table</xref>.

            Evaluating the derivatives at <m>a = 0</m> and finding the various values of <m>c_k</m>, we see the results in <xref ref="T-8a-3-act-3-geom-soln-2">Table</xref>:

            What pattern do you observe in the value of <m>c_k</m>?  State the degree <m>5</m> Taylor polynomial, <m>T_5(x)</m>, as well as the formula you expect for the general degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial, <m>T_n(x)</m>.

        <p>
            We see that for every <m>k</m>, <m>c_k = 1</m>.  Thus,

            By identifying the value of <m>r</m>, explain why the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial <m>T_n(x)</m> can be thought of as a finite geometric series.

        <p><m>T_n(x)</m> is a finite geometric sum with <m>r = x</m> and <m>a = 1</m>.

        <p>
            Note that each subsequent term in <m>T_n(x)</m> results from multiplying the previous term by <m>x</m>, so <m>T_n(x)</m> is a finite geometric sum with <m>r = x</m> and <m>a = 1</m>.

            What is the Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>?  (As we will see in the next section, the <q>Taylor series</q> of a function is the infinite series that results by simply extending the Taylor polynomials indefinitely.)

              T(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots

            which is an infinite geometric sum with <m>a = 1</m> and <m>r = x</m> whose sum (for <m>|r| = |x| \lt 1</m>) is <m>\frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-x} = f(x)</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            If we let the finite sum continue indefinitely, we see that the Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> is
            <me>
              T(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
