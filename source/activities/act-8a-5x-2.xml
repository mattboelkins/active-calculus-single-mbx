  <statement>
    <p>
      In this activity we apply the Lagrange Error Bound to quantify the accuracy of several different approximations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the degree <m>10</m> Taylor polynomial (centered at <m>a = 0</m>) of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> to estimate the value of <m>e^2</m>.  What is the maximum error of your estimate, according to the Lagrange Error Bound?  How does this compare to the actual error between <m>e^2</m> and <m>T_{10}(2)</m> as reported by a computer algebra system?
          </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                Use a degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial (centered at <m>a = 0</m>) of <m>f(x) = \cos(x)</m> to estimate the value of <m>\cos(1)</m> within an accuracy of <m>0.00000001</m>.  According to the Lagrange Error Bound, what value of <m>n</m> is needed to achieve this accuracy?  What is the resulting approximate value of <m>\cos(1)</m>?

                Recall that for <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, its Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> is given by 
                <me>
                    \ln(1+x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}\frac{1}{n}x^n + \cdots
                </me>
                and that the <m>n^{\mbox{th}}</m> derivative of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> is given by
                <me>
                    f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^{n-1}(n-1)!}{(1+x)^n}
                </me>.
                If we want to estimate <m>f(0.5) = \ln(1.5)</m> to within an accuracy of <m>0.0001</m>, what value of <m>n</m> is needed to achieve this accuracy from computing <m>T_n(0.5)</m>, according to the Lagrange Error Bound?
