    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8a-1-2">Activity</xref>, we used <m>f(x) = e^x</m> as a case study to investigate polynomial approximations to <m>f(x)</m> near near <m>a = 0</m>.  For the degree <m>3</m> approximation, we chose the conditions <m>T_3(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>T_3'(0) = f'(0)</m>, <m>T_3''(0) = f''(0)</m>, and <m>T_3'''(0) = f'''(0)</m>.  Starting with <m>T_3(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3</m> and <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, we found the first three derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>T_3</m> and evaluated them at <m>a = 0</m>, which led to the results below.
      <md>

    <p>
      Equating the function and derivative values of <m>f</m> and <m>T_3</m> at <m>a = 0</m>, it follows
      <me>c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1, 2c_2 = 1, 6c_3 = 1</me>
      and therefore
      <me>c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1, c_2 = \frac{1}{2}, c_3 = \frac{1}{6}</me>
      so that <me>T_3(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3</me>.  Moreover, plotting <m>f</m> and <m>T_3</m> near <m>a = 0</m>, we see in <xref ref="F-8a-2-intro">Figure</xref> that the interval of accuracy for a tolerance of <m>0.1</m> is about <m>-1.2 \le x \le 1.2</m>.  
    </p>

      More precisely, we might compute that <m>|f(-1.16) - T_3(-1.16)| \approx 0.0608</m> and <m>|f(1.16) - T_3(1.16)| \approx 0.0970</m>, which helps us see the degree <m>3</m> approximation is quite accurate on an interval wider than <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.
    </p>
    -->

    <p>
      One important pattern we observed in our work with <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is that for every natural number <m>n</m>, the <m>n^{\text{th}}</m> derivative's value at <m>a=0</m> is <m>f^{(n)}(0) = 1</m>.  As we will see, this information will ultimately help us find a general formula for <m>c_n</m>, the coefficient of <m>x^n</m> in the degree <m>n</m> polynomial approximation of <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we will learn how we can more systematically find degree <m>n</m> approximations for functions that have at least <m>n</m> derivatives, as well as how to center the approximation at a value other than <m>a = 0</m>.

    <title>Taylor polynomials</title>
    <p>
      In our work so far in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we have found several different approximations of two important functions: <m>e^x</m> and <m>\sin(x)</m>.  In <xref ref="sec-8a-1-linear-poly">Section</xref>, we saw that near <m>a = 0</m>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x</m> (the degree <m>1</m> approximation);
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> (the degree <m>2</m> approximation);  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3</m> (the degree <m>3</m> approximation); and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + \frac{1}{24}x^4</m> (the degree <m>4</m> approximation).
          </p>
        </li>        
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-2">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw further that 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sin(x) \approx x</m> (the degree <m>1</m> approximation); and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{1}{6}x^3</m> (the degree <m>3</m> approximation).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We've also observed that as the degree of the approximation increases, the polynomial approximation gets more accurate by being closer to the original function <m>f(x)</m> at each fixed value of <m>x</m> as well as on a wider interval.  To find better and better approximations of any function with a sufficient number of derivatives, we naturally want to find approximations of arbitrary degree <m>n</m>.  We thus define the <term>Taylor polynomial of degree <m>n</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></term>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-Taylor-poly-0">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f</m> be a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a = 0</m>.  The <term>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></term> is the function
            <me>
              T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + \cdots + c_nx^n
            </me>
          that satisfies
          <me>
            T_n(0) = f(0), T_n'(0) = f'(0), T_n''(0) = f''(0), \ldots, T_n^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)
          </me>.         
        </p>

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      By definition, <m>T_n</m> is the polynomial whose function value and first <m>n</m> derivative values at <m>a = 0</m> match the function value and all <m>n</m> derivative values of <m>f</m> at <m>a = 0</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The <m>n+1</m> equations 
      <me>
        T_n(0) = f(0), T_n'(0) = f'(0), T_n''(0) = f''(0), \ldots, T_n^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)
      </me> 
      enable us to determine the coefficients <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m> in terms of the values of the various derivatives of <m>f</m>.  First, we take <m>n</m> derivatives of <m>T_n(x)</m>, and assemble those below.  As we do so, we choose not to combine products of numbers that arise in order to see certain patterns in the coefficients.
      <md>
        <mrow>T_n(x) \amp= c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + c_3x^3 + c_4x^4 + \cdots + c_nx^n</mrow>

      </md> 
    </p>                
    <p>
      Next, we evaluate each of the derivatives of <m>T_n(x)</m> at <m>a = 0</m> and set each result equal to the corresponding derivative value of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>a = 0</m>, which ultimately enables us to determine the coefficients <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m>.  These two steps are summarized in <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref>.  Note how we use the index variable, <m>k</m>, to track the various derivatives of <m>T_n</m> and <m>f</m>.

    <p>
      We see a natural pattern that results from taking the <m>k^{\text{th}}</m> derivative of the <m>k{\text{th}}</m> power of <m>x</m>, <m>x^k</m>.  For example, the repeated derivatives of <m>x^4</m> are <m>4x^3</m>, <m>(4 \cdot 3) x^2</m>, <m>(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) x</m>, and finally <m>4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.  By the time we get to the fourth derivative of <m>x^4</m>, only a constant remains, and that constant is the factorial<fn>For any positive whole number <m>n</m>, its factorial, <m>n!</m>, is the product of all of the positive whole numbers less than or equal to <m>n</m>: <m>n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.</fn> 
      <me>
        \frac{d^4}{dx^4}\left[ x^4 \right] = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4!
      </me>
      From the rightmost column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref>, we now see how the values of <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m> are determined by the values of the various derivatives evaluated at <m>a = 0</m>, each scaled by a corresponding factorial.  In particular, solving each equation in the rightmost column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref> for <m>c_k</m>, we see that
      <me>
        c_0 = f(0), c_1 = f'(0), c_2 = \frac{f''(0)}{2!}, c_3 = \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}, \ldots, c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}
      </me>
      This enables us to find the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial for any function <m>f</m> by finding the values of <m>f(0), f'(0), f''(0), \ldots, f^{(n)}(0)</m> and using these numbers to determine <m>c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n</m>.  We summarize our recent work as follows.

        <p>
          When finding the coefficients of a Taylor polynomial, it is often helpful to <em>not</em> combine products such as <m>(-3)(-2)(-1)</m> and <m>(-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)</m> into a single number, in order to better observe patterns; indeed, by not combining the constants that arise in higher derivatives of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, we see patterns of alternating signs and factorials that arise.  From the last six rows of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-example">Table</xref> and the fact that <m>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}</m>, we find that
          <md>
            <mrow> c_0 \amp= f(0) = 0 </mrow>
            <mrow> c_1 \amp= f'(0) = 1 </mrow>
            <mrow> c_2 \amp= \frac{1}{2!}f''(0) = \frac{-1}{2!} = -\frac{1}{2} </mrow>
            <mrow> c_3 \amp= \frac{1}{3!}f'''(0) = \frac{(-2)(-1)}{3!} = \frac{1}{3} </mrow>
            <mrow> c_4 \amp= \frac{1}{4!}f^{(4)}(0) = \frac{(-3)(-2)(-1)}{4!} = -\frac{1}{4} </mrow>
            <mrow> c_5 \amp= \frac{1}{5!}f^{(5)}(0) = \frac{(-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)}{5!} = \frac{1}{5}</mrow>
          </md>
          so that the degree <m>5</m> Taylor approximation of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> at <m>a = 0</m> is
          <me>
            T_5(x) = 1x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5
          </me>.
          Thus, we have found the approximation 
          <me>
            \ln(1+x) \approx 1x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5
          </me>,
          and by plotting <m>T_5(x)</m> along with <m>f(x)</m> and <m>T_1(x)</m> in <xref ref="F-8a-2-log-example">Figure</xref>, we see how much better the degree <m>5</m> approximation is than the tangent line approximation.

    <p>
      From our work in <xref ref="Ex-8a-2-Taylor-example">Example</xref>, we see the pattern that arises in the various derivatives of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>.  We therefore find that the general degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> is
      <me>
        T_n(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \cdots + (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}x^n.
      </me>
      For many familiar functions, a pattern emerges in their derivatives that enables us to find the general form of the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial.

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8a-2-1.xml" />

    <p>
      Our work so far with the functions <m>e^x</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, and <m>\ln(1+x)</m> has revealed patterns in their derivatives that enable us to find even higher degree Taylor polynomials easily.  Furthermore, these higher degree polynomials provide outstanding approximations that only require the use of addition and multiplication.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, in <xref ref="act-8a-2-1">Activity</xref>, we found that the degree <m>8</m> Taylor approximation of the cosine function at <m>a = 0</m> is
      <me>
        T_8(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \frac{1}{6!}x^6 + \frac{1}{8!}x^8
      </me>,
      so 
      <me>
        \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \frac{1}{6!}x^6 + \frac{1}{8!}x^8 
      </me>.
      The pattern of alternating signs and even numbers in the factorials and powers of <m>x</m> lets us see that we could easily write down, say, <m>T_{20}(x)</m>.  We can reason similarly to extend what we found in <xref ref="PA-8a-2">Preview Activity</xref> and observe that
      <me>
        \sin(x) \approx T_7(x) = x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7
      </me>,
      the degree <m>7</m> Taylor approximation of the sine function at <m>a = 0</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>  
      When we ask a computational device to find numerical estimates for quantities such as <m>e^2</m>, <m>\sin(1)</m>, and <m>\cos(1.2)</m>, high degree Taylor polynomials are one approach<fn>For computing values of trigonometric functions, a method known as <url href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07468342.2009.11922342" visual="tandfonline.com">CORDIC</url> (that remarkably doesn't even use multiplication) is employed by many calculating devices.</fn> that can be used to generate the results.  For example, 
      <me>
        \sin(1) \approx T_7(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3!}1^3 + \frac{1}{5!}1^5 - \frac{1}{7!}1^7 = \frac{4241}{5040} \approx 0.84146825
      </me>
       is a surprisingly accurate estimate of <m>\sin(1) = 0.84147098 \ldots</m> that only involves the sum of four rational numbers.

    <title>
      Taylor polynomial approximations centered at an arbitrary value <m>a</m>
    </title>

    <p>
      In all of our work so far in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we have focused on approximating functions such as <m>e^x</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\ln(1+x)</m>, and <m>\cos(x)</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.  But we could instead be interested in the behavior of some function <m>f</m> near <m>a = 5</m>, or be interested in a function <m>f</m> that wasn't even defined at <m>a = 0</m>.  Thus, we next generalize our earlier work to Taylor polynomial approximations centered at any value <m>a</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From our early studies in <xref ref="sec-1-8-tan-line-approx">Section</xref>, we know that at any input value <m>x = a</m> where a function <m>f</m> has a first derivative, <m>f</m> has a tangent line approximation 
      <me>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</me>
      that satisfies <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> for <m>x</m> values near <m>a</m>.  Provided that <m>f</m> has a second derivative at <m>x=a</m>, we can build a quadratic approximation near <m>a</m> for <m>f</m>, similar to the one we found at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x)=e^x</m> in <xref ref="act-8a-1-2">Activity</xref>.  In addition, as long as <m>f</m> has a third derivative at <m>x=a</m>, we can even find a cubic approximation (just as we did at <m>a = 0</m> in <xref ref="act-8a-1-3">Activity</xref>), and so on.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In developing such approximations centered at any value <m>x = a</m>, our guiding principle is the same as with our work at <m>a = 0</m>: we'll require that at the input value <m>a</m>, the original function's output and its derivatives' outputs match the corresponding approximation's output and derivatives' output.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building on the form of the tangent line approximation, which we now denote <m>T_1(x)</m>,
      <me>
        T_1(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      </me>, 
      it is natural for us to consider quadratic and cubic approximations of form 
      <me>
        T_2(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2, {\text{ and}}
      </me>, 
      a cubic approximation of form 
      <me>
        T_3(x) = c_0 + c_1 (x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2 + c_3(x-a)^3
      </me>, 
      and so on.  We define the more general degree <m>n</m> Taylor Polynomial centered at <m>a</m> as follows.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-Taylor-poly-a">
      <statement>
        <p>
         Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f</m> be a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a</m>.  The <term>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></term> is the function
         <me>
          T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots + c_n(x-a)^n
         </me>
         that satisfies
         <m>
          T_n(a) = f(a), T_n'(a) = f'(a), T_n''(a) = f''(a), \ldots, T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)           
         </m>. 
        </p>
        
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Similar to the situation when <m>a = 0</m>, it follows that we can find the coefficients <m>c_k</m> of the Taylor polynomial in terms of the various derivatives of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>a</m>.  
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="find-Taylor-poly-a">
      <title>Finding the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></title>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a</m>,
        then the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m>, <m>T_n(x)</m>, is  
        <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots + c_n(x-a)^n</me>

    <p>
      As with approximations centered at <m>a = 0</m>, the Taylor polynomial now provides us with an approximation of <m>f</m> near <m>a</m>.  In particular,

        <p>
          Provided that a function <m>f(x)</m> has <m>n</m> derivatives at a selected input value <m>x = a</m>, we can find a degree <m>n</m> polynomial <m>T_n(x)</m> that approximates <m>f(x)</m> near <m>a</m> by requiring that <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n'(a) = f'(a)</m>, <m>T_n''(a) = f''(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.

      <li>  
        <p>
          When <m>a = 0</m>, the degree <m>n</m> polynomial approximation, <m>T_n(x)</m>, to a function <m>f(x)</m>, centered at <m>a = 0</m>, is a polynomial of the form
          <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots + c_n x^n</me>
          and it follows that the coefficients <m>c_k</m> are determined by the values of the various derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> evaluated at <m>0</m> according to the formula
          <me>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}.</me>
          Therefore, for <m>x</m> near <m>a = 0</m>, 
          <me>
            f(x) \approx T_n(x) = f(0) + f'(0) x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!} x^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>  
        <p>
          Just as we can consider any function <m>f</m> that has <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a = 0</m> and find approximations centered there, we can also consider any input value <m>a</m> at which those <m>n</m> derivatives exist, and find a polynomial approximation that satisfies <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n'(a) = f'(a)</m>, <m>T_n''(a) = f''(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          At such a value <m>a</m>, the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m> has form 
          <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1 (x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2 + \cdots + c_n (x-a)^n</me>
          and it follows that the coefficients <m>c_k</m> are determined by the values of the various derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> evaluated at <m>a</m> according to the formula
          <me>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}.</me>
          Thus, for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>,

            f(x) \approx T_n(x) = f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n
