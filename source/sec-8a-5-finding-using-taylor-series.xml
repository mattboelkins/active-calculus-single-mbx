        <p>
          Is it possible to find the Taylor series expansion for a given function <m>f</m> without computing and evaluating various derivatives of <m>f</m>?

      <li>
        <p>
          Can we differentiate or integrate a Taylor series similar to how we differentiate or integrate a polynomial?  If so, how does doing so affect the values of <m>x</m> for which the Taylor series converges?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </objectives>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have focused our attention on a collection of five basic functions functions <mdash/> <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, <m>\ln(1+x)</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, and <m>e^x</m> <mdash/> and their Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m>.  One of the reasons we were able to find these Taylor series is the patterns that arise in the derivatives of each of these functions.  While we can always use <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref> to find the first few terms of the Taylor series, for most functions it is challenging to find a pattern among the various derivatives that allows us to state the general <m>n</m>th term of the series.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref>, we explore this issue and investigate a different approach to finding the Taylor series of a given function.

  <subsection>
    <title>Using substitution and algebra to find new Taylor series expressions</title>
    <p>
      The substitution technique we used in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> can be used to find the Taylor series for any function whose structure is similar to that of a Taylor series we already know.  
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-8a-5-cosx3">
      <statement>
        Find the Taylor series expansion for <m>g(x) = x^4 \cos(x^3)</m> and determine the <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges.
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because <m>\cos(x^3)</m> is part of the function whose Taylor series we seek, we start with the familiar series for <m>\cos(x)</m>.  We know that 
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosu">
            f(u) = \cos(u) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}u^2 + \frac{1}{4!}u^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} u^{2n} + \cdots
          </men>
          for all real numbers <m>u</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          By letting <m>u = x^3</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref>, it follows that
          <me>
            \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}(x^3)^2 + \frac{1}{4!}(x^3)^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} (x^3)^{2n} + \cdots
          </me>, 
          so
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosx3">
            \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^6 + \frac{1}{4!}x^{12} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n} + \cdots
          </men>.      
          Then, multiplying both sides of <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> by <m>x^4</m>, we find that 
          <me>
            g(x) = x^4 \cos(x^3) = x^4 - \frac{1}{2!}x^{10} + \frac{1}{4!}x^{16} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n+4} + \cdots
          </me>.
          Since <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>u</m>, letting <m>u = x^3</m> tells us that <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>x</m>.  The Ratio Test can be used to show that multiplying every term of a Taylor series by the same power of <m>x</m> does not change the set of <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges, so the Taylor series for <m>g(x)</m> also converges for every value of <m>x</m>.
        </p>          
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Because the approaches in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> and <xref ref="ex-8a-5-cosx3">Example</xref> each require us to use a known Taylor series, we restate the Taylor series we've established so far for <m>5</m> important functions in <xref ref="T-8a-5-big-5-redux">Table</xref>.

    <title>
      Differentiating and integrating Taylor series
    </title>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="C-5">Chapter</xref>, we discussed the challenge posed by definite integrals such as
      <me>
        \int_0^1 \sin(x^2) \, dx
      </me>.
      Because we are unable to find a simple algebraic antiderivative for the function <m>\sin(x^2)</m>, we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral exactly.  We learned in <xref ref="sec-5-2-FTC2">Section</xref> that the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides us with an antiderivative of a given function by using an integral function: one antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m> is 
      <me>
        F(x) = \int_0^x \sin(u^2) \, du
      </me>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Our recent work with Taylor series now suggests another way to find an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m> for <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>, and this approach also provides new options for finding additional Taylor series.  In <xref ref="act-8a-5-1">Activity</xref>, as part of our work in finding a Taylor series for <m>x^3 \sin(x^2)</m> we found that
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-ex2">
        \sin(x^2) = x^2 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \frac{1}{5!}x^{10} - \frac{1}{7!}x^{14} + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \frac{1}{(2n-1)!} x^{4n-2} + \cdots
      </men>
      and that this representation of <m>\sin(x^2)</m> is valid for every value of <m>x</m>.  This infinite series representation suggests that we could find an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m> of <m>\sin(x^2)</m> by using <xref ref="eq-8a-5-ex2">Equation</xref> to actually evaluate the integral <m> \int_0^x \sin(u^2) \, du</m>.  Doing so, we see
      <md>
        <mrow>F(x) =\mathstrut \amp \int_0^x \sin(u^2) \, du</mrow>
        <mrow> =\mathstrut \amp \int_0^x \left( u^2 - \frac{1}{3!}u^6 + \frac{1}{5!}u^{10} + \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} \frac{1}{(2n-1)!} u^{4n-2} + \cdots \right) \, du</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \left. \frac{1}{3}u^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} u^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}u^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} u^{4n-1} + \cdots \right|_0^x</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \left( \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} x^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}x^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} x^{4n-1} + \cdots \right) - 0</mrow>    
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} x^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}x^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} x^{4n-1} + \cdots </mrow>                    
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence we have found that 
      <me>
        F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} x^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}x^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} x^{4n-1} + \cdots
      </me>
      is an antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it is natural to wonder how integrating a Taylor series might change the values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges, it turns out that integrating a Taylor series has almost no effect<fn>It is possible for the convergence status at the endpoints of the interval to change, but we are normally not concerned with those specific <m>x</m>-values.</fn> on where the series converges (nor does differentiating such a series).  This fact is stated formally in a result called The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem.  (A <term>power series</term> is any series of the form <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k</m>; every Taylor series is a power series, and a famous result called Borel's Theorem tells us that every power series is in fact the Taylor series of a related function.)
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="T-PS-diff-int">
      <title>The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem</title>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k</m> converges for <m>|x-a| \lt R</m> for a positive real number <m>R</m>, then
        <me>
          f'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot c_k (x-a)^{k-1}
        </me>
        and 
        <me>
          \int f(x) \, dx = C + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_k}{k+1} (x-a)^{k+1}
        </me>
        and both of these series converge if <m>|x-a| \lt R</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Stated more informally, the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that when it comes to differentiating or integrating a Taylor series, we can do so just as if they were finite polynomials:  we can differentiate or integrate the Taylor series term-wise following the Power Rule for differentiating or integrating <m>x^n</m>.  Moreover, doing so doesn't change the interval on which the Taylor series converges<fn>Differentiating or integrating can change the convergence status at the endpoints of the interval, but we again will not concern ourselves with that issue in this course.</fn>.  Since polynomials are the easiest of all functions to differentiate and integrate, we can now find many more Taylor series of interesting functions.

    <p>
      Near the end of <xref ref="sec-8a-4-taylor-series">Section</xref>, we noted the important big-picture perspective that for familiar basic functions that are infinitely differentiable, such as <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, not only can we find the function's Taylor series and determine the <m>x</m>-values for which the Taylor series converges, but <em>the Taylor series converges to the function itself</em>.  Furthermore, we noted that these representations play a key role in how computers provide decimal approxations to quantities such as <m>\sin(1)</m>, which can be represented as 
      <me>
        \sin(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{5!} - \frac{1}{7!} + \cdots
      </me>.
      Our most recent work with Taylor series shows that the news is better still:  now we can easily represent even more complicated functions with Taylor series, such as <m>f(x) = e^{-x^2}</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>, and determine their antiderivatives using their infinite Taylor series and treating that representation just like a polynomial.  In the ***NEXT**** section, we investigate further how certain infinite series of numbers can be easily and accurately approximated using partial sums that result from evaluating Taylor series.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Through substitution, we can use any known Taylor series to find the Taylor series of a related function.  For example, we know that if <m>|u| \lt 1</m>, 
          <me>
            \ln(1+u) = u - \frac{1}{2}u^2 + \frac{1}{3}u^3 - \frac{1}{4}u^4 + \cdots
          </me>
          Letting <m>u = 4x^2</m>, it follows that 
          <me>
            \ln(1+4x^2) = 4x^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16x^4 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 64x^6  - \frac{1}{4} \cdot 256x^8 + \cdots
          </me>
          and that this representation converges if <m>|4x^2| \lt 1</m>, so for <m>x</m> such that <m>|x| \lt \frac{1}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Power Series Differentation and Integration Theorem tells us that we can differentiate or integrate a Taylor series in the natural way and that doing so has essentially no impact on the set of <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges.  For instance, we might note that if we first found the Taylor series for <m>\sin(x)</m>, which is
          <me>
            \sin(x) = x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7 + \cdots
          </me>
          and converges for every value of <m>x</m>, it follows by differentating that
          <md>
            <mrow>\cos(x) =\mathstrut \amp \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]</mrow>
            <mrow>        =\mathstrut \amp \frac{d}{dx}[x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7 + \cdots]</mrow>
            <mrow>        =\mathstrut \amp 1 - \frac{1}{3!} \cdot 3x^2 + \frac{1}{5!} \cdot 5x^4 - \frac{1}{7!} \cdot 7x^6 + \cdots</mrow>

          </md>
          which is precisely the Taylor series for <m>\cos(x)</m> that we found by taking derivatives and applying <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref>.
