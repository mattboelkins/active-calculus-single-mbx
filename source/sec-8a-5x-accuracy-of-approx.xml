  <title>Quantifying the accuracy of approximations</title>
  <objectives>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For an infinite series that converges, how much accuracy do we lose when we truncate the series after a finite number of terms to approximate its value with a finite sum?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is an alternating series and how can we determine whether or not it converges?  How do the partial sums of a converging alternating series accurately estimate its exact sum?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the Lagrange Error Bound and how can we use it to understand how accurate a function's degree-<m>n</m> Taylor polynomial approximation is?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </objectives>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This section is all about understanding precisely how accurate certain approximations are.  Through Taylor series, we now know that we can represent certain functions and their values exactly through infinite sums.  For example, we know that for any value of <m>x</m>, 
      <me>
        e^x = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}x^n + \cdots
      </me>
      so it follows that 
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5x-exp-1-2">
        e^{-1/2} = 1 + \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2!} \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^2 + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!} \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^n + \cdots
      </men>. 
      If we decide to estimate the exact value of <m>e^{-1/2}</m> using the first <m>5</m> terms of this infinite sum, it turns out to be possible to use both the fact that we chose <q><m>5</m></q> and properties of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> to quantify the maximum error in the estimate
      <me>
        e^{-1/2} \approx 1 + \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2!} \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^3 + \frac{1}{4!} \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^4
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we have seen, most of the infinite series that arise (such as the one in <xref ref="eq-8a-5x-exp-1-2">Equation</xref>) are not geometric.  But since geometric series are among the easiest infinite series to understand and evaluate, we use a geometric series as the starting point for our analysis of approximation errors.  In <xref ref="PA-8a-5x">Preview Activity</xref>, we investigate an example of a convergent geometric series and explore how we can use terms in the series itself to quantify how accurate a partial sum approximation is.

    <title>
      Alternating series of real numbers
    </title>

    <p>
      Next we consider the definite integral
      <me>
        \int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx
      </me>,
      which is related to the well-known error function, <m>\erf(x)</m>.  
      While we are unable to find an elementary algebraic antiderivative of <m>e^{-x^2}</m>, if we use the Taylor series 
      <me>
        e^{-x^2} = 1 - x^2 + \frac{1}{2!}x^4 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{n!} x^{2n} + \cdots
      </me>
      and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the series representation of <m>e^{-x^2}</m>, we find that
      <mdn>
        <mrow number="no">\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx =\mathstrut \amp \int_0^1 \left( 1 - x^2 + \frac{1}{2!}x^4 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{n!} x^{2n} + \cdots \right) \, dx</mrow>
        <mrow number="no"> =\mathstrut \amp \left. x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2!} x^5 + \cdots +  \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1) n!} x^{2n+1} + \cdots \right|_0^1 </mrow>
        <mrow number="no"> =\mathstrut \amp \left(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2!} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1) n!} + \cdots \right) - \left( 0 \right)</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq-8a-5x-alt-sum-ex2"> =\mathstrut \amp 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2!} - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1) n!} + \cdots</mrow>
      </mdn>   
      Like the geometric series <m>\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k </m> that we encountered in <xref ref="PA-8a-5x">Preview Activity</xref>, the infinite series in <xref ref="eq-8a-5x-alt-sum-ex2">Equation</xref> is an example of an <term>alternating series</term> of real numbers.  It turns out to be straightforward to determine whether or not an alternating series converges and to estimate the value of a convergent alternating series. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An alternating series is a series of the form
          <me>
            \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k
          </me>,
          where <m>a_k \gt 0</m> for each <m>k</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We will only consider alternating series for which the sequence of positive numbers <m>a_k</m> decreases to <m>0</m>.  The following example illustrates two general results that hold for any alternating series whose terms <m>a_k</m> decrease to <m>0</m>.  We use a geometric series so that we can know its exact sum and compare certain computations to that sum.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-5x">Preview Activity</xref>, we investigated the partial sums of the convergent alternating geometric series <m>S = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k</m>, whose sum is <m>S = \fra{5}{9}</m>.  We found the first several partial sums shown in **TABLE**.

          In both the table and the figure, we see how consecutive partial sums move back and forth above and below the exact sum of the infinite series, <m>\frac{5}{9}</m>, and moreover how the amount the next partial sum lies above or below <m>\frac{5}{9}</m> is less than the amount by which the previous partial sum deviated.  For instance, 
          <me>
            |S_5 - \frac{5}{9}| \approx 0.1820,
          </me>
          but 
          <me>
            |S_6 - \frac{5}{9}| \approx 0.1456
          </me>.
          Moreover, since <m>S_6 = S_5 - \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^5</m>, and <m>-\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^5 = -0.32768</m> is the last and smallest term (in absolute value) in <m>S_6</m>, <m>0.32768</m> is the total vertical distance from the point <m>(5, S_5)</m> to <m>(6, S_6)</m> in <xref ref="F-8a-5x-alt-partial-sums">Figure</xref>.  This implies that <m>0.32768</m> is more than the error in comparing <m>S_5</m> and <m>S</m>.  Said differently, we are guaranteed that
          <me>
            |S - S_5| \lt \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^5
          </me>
          so the next term in the sum provides a bound on the error in a given partial sum.  A similar argument can be made for any value of <m>n</m>.
        </p>

    <p>  
      A more general version of this argument can be made for any alternating series whose terms go to zero.  This leads us to state two important results.

      <title>The Alternating Series Test</title>
      <p>
        Given an alternating series
        <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k
        </me>,
        if the positive terms <m>a_k</m> decrease to 0 as <m>k \to \infty</m>,
        then the alternating series converges.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      If we were to compute the partial sums <m>S_n</m> of any alternating series whose terms decrease to zero and plot the points <m>(n,S_n)</m> as we did in <xref ref="F-8a-5x-alt-partial-sums">Figure</xref>, we would see a similar picture:  the partial sums alternate above and below the value to which the infinite alternating series converges.  In addition, because the terms go to zero, the amount a given partial sum deviates from the total sum is at most the next term in the series.  This result is formally stated as the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.

    <p>  
      The arguments <xref ref="eq-8a-5x-alt-sum-ex2">Example</xref> can be made for any alternating series whose terms go to zero.  This leads us to state two important results.

        has positive terms <m>a_k</m> that decrease to zero as <m>k \to \infty</m>, and

      Again, this result simply says: if we use a partial sum to estimate the exact sum of an alternating series, the absolute error of the approximation is less than the next term in the series.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If we let <m>S</m> be the value of the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}</m>,
          then we know that

            \left| S_{100} - S \right| \lt  a_{101}
          </me>.

        <p>
          Now
          <me>
            a_{101} = \frac{1}{101} \approx 0.0099
          </me>,
          so the 100th partial sum is within 0.0099 of the exact value of the series.  In addition, it turns out that <m>S_{100} \approx 0.688172</m> and <m>S = \ln(2) \approx 0.69314</m>, so we see that the difference between <m>S_{100}</m> and <m>S</m> is indeed less than the error bound of <m>0.0099</m> from the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.

    <title>Summary</title>

        <p>
          An alternating series is one whose terms alternate in sign, usually represented by <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k</m> where <m>a_k \gt 0</m> for all values of <m>k</m>.  Any alternating series whose terms <m>a_k</m> approach zero as <m>k \to \infty</m> is guaranteed to converge.  Moreover, the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem tells us that we can estimate the exact value of a converging alternating series by using a partial sum, and the error of that approximation is at most the next term in the series.
