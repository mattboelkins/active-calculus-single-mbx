    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      A powerful feature of mathematics is that it can be studied both as an abstract discipline and as an applied one. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of functions.  At the same time,
      if we consider functions that represent meaningful processes, calculus can describe our experience of physical reality. We have already learned that for the position function
      <m>y = s(t)</m> of a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the derivative of the position function, <m>v(t) = s'(t)</m>, gives the ball's velocity at time <m>t</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we investigate several functions with contextual physical meaning and consider how the units on the independent variable, dependent variable, and the derivative function add to our understanding.

    <title>Units of the derivative function</title>
    <p>
      We know that the derivative of the function <m>f</m> at a fixed value <m>x</m> is given by
      <me>
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      and that this value has several different interpretations.  For instance, if we set <m>x = a</m>, <m>f'(a)</m> is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We sometimes write <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> instead of <m>f'(x)</m>,
      and these alternate notations emphasize the meaning of the derivative as
      <em>the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m></em>.
          <idx><h>instantaneous rate of change</h></idx>
      To understand the units on the derivative function, we use the fact that the instantaneous rate of change is the limit of the average rate of change.  Recall that the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> is
      <me>AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h) - a}</me>, 
      which is the quotient 
      <me>
        \frac{\mbox{change in } f}{\mbox{change in } x}
      </me>. 
      It follows that the units on the average rate of change are: 
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.        
        </p>
      </blockquote>  
      Note that since <m>(a+h) - a = h</m>, we usually write <me>AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</me>.    
    </p>
    <p>  
      Thus, when we take the limit of the average rate of change as <m>h</m> goes to zero, the derivative 
      <me>f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</me> 
      has the same units: units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.

      Said slightly differently, the units on the derivative function are <q>units of output per unit of input</q> for the variables and context of the original function, <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-1-5a-1-pop-growth">
	    <title>Population growth</title>
	    <statement>
	      <p> Suppose that the function <m>y = P(t)</m> measures the population of a city (in thousands) at the start of year <m>t</m> (where <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to the year 2020). What does 
          <me>P'(2) = 21.37</me> 
        mean in context?
 	      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        The value <m>P'(2) = 21.37</m> tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2022 is <m>21.37</m> thousand people per year, since <m>P</m> is measured in thousands of people and <m>t</m> is measured in years.  In addition, because the derivative value tells us how fast the population is changing, we can also infer about how much the population will change:  we expect that in the year from 2022 to 2023, about <m>21,370</m> people will be added to the city's population.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <example xml:id="Ex-1-5a-2-time-speed">
      <title>Time as a function of speed</title>
      <statement>
        <p> 
        Consider the function <m>T(s) = \frac{50}{s}</m> from <xref ref="PA-1-5">Preview Activity</xref>, whose output tells us the amount of time (in hours) it takes to drive 50 miles at <m>s</m> miles per hour.  What is the meaning of

        </me>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The value <m>T'(60) = -0.0139</m> means that the instantaneous rate of change of travel time, <m>T</m>, when <m>s = 60</m> is <m>-0.0139</m> hours per (mile per hour).  This also tells us about how much the function value will change if we change the speed at which we drive:  if we are driving at a speed of <m>60</m> miles per hour and we increase our speed by one mile per hour, we expect the time it takes us to drive 50 miles to drop by about <m>0.0139</m> hours.  Similarly, if we increase our speed by two miles per hour, 
          we'd expect the time it takes us to drive 50 miles to drop by about <m>2 \cdot 0.0139 = 0.0278</m> hours.

        <p>
          It is usually best <em>not</em> to simplify complicated units on a rate of change, but rather to leave their form as <q>(units of output) per (unit of input)</q>.
        </p>
      </note>
        <p>
          The units on <m>T'(60)</m> in <xref ref="Ex-1-5a-2-time-speed">Example</xref> are <q>hours per (mile per hour)</q>, since the number of hours it takes to drive 50 miles depends on the speed (in miles per hour) at which we travel.  If we tried to simplify those units, we lose the meaning inherent to the context of the value of <m>T'(60)</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Toward more accurate derivative estimates</title>
    <p>
      Recall that to estimate the value of <m>f'(a)</m> at a given value of <m>x = a</m>,
      we can compute a <em>difference quotient</em>
          <idx><h>difference quotient</h></idx>
      <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> with a relatively small value of <m>h</m>.  We usually use both positive and negative values of <m>h</m> in order to account for the behavior of the function on both sides of the point of interest. In the setting where we have limited data, we introduce the notion of a
      <em>central difference</em> for estimating the value of <m>f'(a)</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-1-5-1-central-difference">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>y = f(x)</m> is a function for which three values are known: <m>f(1) = 2.5</m>, <m>f(2) = 3.25</m>, and <m>f(3) = 3.625</m>.  Estimate <m>f'(2)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that <m>f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h}</m>. But since we don't have a graph or a formula for the function, we can neither sketch a tangent line nor evaluate the limit algebraically, nor can we use smaller and smaller values of <m>h</m> to estimate the limit. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          Instead, we have just two choices: using <m>h = -1</m> or <m>h = 1</m>, depending on which point we pair with <m>(2,3.25)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, one estimate is
          <me>
            f'(2) \approx \frac{f(1)-f(2)}{1-2} = \frac{2.5-3.25}{-1} = 0.75
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other is
          <me>
            f'(2) \approx \frac{f(3)-f(2)}{3-2} = \frac{3.625-3.25}{1} = 0.375
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the first approximation looks backward from the point <m>(2,3.25)</m> and the second approximation looks forward, it makes sense to average these two estimates in order to account for behavior on both sides of <m>x=2</m>. Doing so, we find that
          <me>
            f'(2) \approx \frac{0.75 + 0.375}{2} = 0.5625
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      When we have two function values for <m>f</m> at equally spaced locations on opposite sides of <m>x=a</m>, the approach of averaging the two estimates <mdash/> as we did in <xref ref="Ex-1-5-1-central-difference">Example</xref> <mdash/> results in the best possible estimate we can find for <m>f'(a)</m> using the two known function values.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see why, let's think about how we look both <q>backward</q> and <q>forward</q> from <m>x=a</m>, like we did for the specific data in <xref ref="Ex-1-5-1-central-difference">Example</xref>.
      Using a
      <em>backward difference</em>, <m>BD</m>,
          <idx><h>backward difference</h></idx>
      one estimate for <m>f'(a)</m> is     
      <me>
        BD = \frac{f(a)-f(a-h)}{a - (a-h)} = \frac{f(a)-f(a-h)}{h}
      </me>. 
      When we instead use a
      <em>forward difference</em>, <m>FD</m>,
          <idx><h>forward difference</h></idx>
      we now get the estimate
      <me>
        FD = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
      </me>.
      Because these two estimates take into account the function's behavior on both sides of <m>x=a</m>, it makes sense to average them to include the most possible information for an even better estimate for the value of <m>f'(a)</m>.  Doing so, we find that
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{BD + FD}{2} \amp= \frac{1}{2}(BD + FD) </mrow>
        <mrow>                   \amp= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{f(a)-f(a-h)}{h} + \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \right) </mrow>
        <mrow>                   \amp= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{f(a)-f(a-h) + f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \right) </mrow>
        <mrow>                   \amp= \frac{f(a+h)-f(a-h)}{2h}</mrow>
      </md>
      We naturally call the resulting estimate a <em>central difference</em>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-1-5-central-difference">
      <idx><h>central difference</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a given value of <m>h</m>, the <term>central difference approximation</term> of <m>f'(a)</m> is given by
          <me>
            f'(a) \approx \frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement> 
    </definition>   

    <p>
      Observe that the central difference is also the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on <m>[a-h,a+h]</m>, 
      <me>
        AV_{[a-h,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h}
      </me>, and thus we can even interpret the central difference as a slope of a certain secant line.

      In <xref ref="F-1-5a-central-diff">Figure</xref>, we see a function that passes through the three data points given in <xref ref="Ex-1-5-1-central-difference">Example</xref>: <m>(1,2.5)</m>, <m>(2,3.25)</m>, and <m>(3,3.265)</m>. The top line in the figure is the tangent line to the curve at <m>(2,f(2))</m>; for the function shown, the slope of that tangent line turns out to be <m>f'(2) = 0.5199</m>.  We found in <xref ref="Ex-1-5-1-central-difference">Example</xref> that the central difference approximation is <m>0.5625</m>, which is the slope of the secant line through the points <m>(1,f(1))</m> and <m>(3,f(3))</m> in <xref ref="F-1-5a-central-diff">Figure</xref>.

      In general, the central difference

        AV_{[a-h,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h}
      </me>
      is the slope of the secant line between the points <m>(a-h,f(a-h))</m> and <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m>.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec-1-4-derivative-fxn">Section</xref>, we learned how use to the graph of a given function <m>f</m> to plot the graph of its derivative, <m>f'</m>.
      It is important to remember that when we do so, the scale (often) and the units (always) on the vertical axis have to change to represent <m>f'</m>. For example, suppose that <m>P(t) = 212-148e^{-0.05t}</m> tells us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of a potato in an oven at time <m>t</m> in minutes. In <xref ref="Fig-1-5a-P">Figure</xref>,
      we sketch the graph of <m>P</m>, and in <xref ref="Fig-1-5a-PPrime">Figure</xref> the graph of <m>P'</m>.
      Notice that the vertical scales are different in size
      and different in units,
      as the units of <m>P</m> are
      <degree />F, while those of <m>P'</m> are <degree />F/min.

    <title>Summary</title>

      <ul>

            The derivative of a given function <m>y=f(x)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable with respect to the input variable.  It also predicts about how much change we can expect when the input variable changes a small amount.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The units on the derivative function
            <m>y = f'(x)</m> are units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.
            Again,
            this measures how fast the output of the function <m>f</m> changes when the input variable changes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by
            <me>
              f'(a) \approx \frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h}
            </me>.
            This quantity measures the slope of the secant line to <m>y = f(x)</m> through the points
            <m>(a-h, f(a-h))</m> and <m>(a+h, f(a+h))</m>.
            The central difference generates a good approximation of the derivative's value at <m>x = a</m>.
          </p>
