      <introduction>
          <p>
            Suppose that you are driving a car on the highway using cruise control so that you drive at a constant speed.  The time, <m>T</m> (measured in hours), it takes to drive 50 miles depends on the constant rate, 
            <m>s</m> (measured in miles per hour) at which you are driving.  Since 
            <me>
              \mbox{distance} = \mbox{rate} \cdot \mbox{travel time}
            </me>,
            it follows that 
            <me>
              \mbox{travel time} =  \frac{\mbox{distance}}{\mbox{rate}}
            </me>,
            and thus we know that <m>T(s) = \frac{50}{s}</m>.  
          </p>
          <p>  
            For instance, observe that <m>T(75) = \frac{50}{75} = \frac{2}{3}</m>, so it takes <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of an hour to drive <m>50</m> miles at <m>75</m> miles per hour, and the point <m>(75, \frac{2}{3})</m> lies on the graph of <m>T(s)</m>.
