      <introduction>
        <p>
            Consider the alternating geometric series 
            <me>
                S = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k = 1 - \frac{4}{5} + \frac{16}{25} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^{n-1} + \cdots
            </me>.  
            We want to explore how the partial sums of the series compare to and approximate the exact sum of the series, which is 
            <me>S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-\left(\frac{-4}{5}\right)} = \frac{1}{\frac{9}{5}} = \frac{5}{9}</me>.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Recall that the <m>n</m>th partial sum, <m>S_n</m>, is the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms of the infinite geometric series <m>S</m>.  This means that
                    <me>
                        S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k = 1 - \frac{4}{5} + \frac{16}{25} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^{n-1}
                    </me>. 
                Note that the exact fractional values of <m>S_1</m>, <m>S_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>S_6</m>, have been recorded below along with their decimal representations.  Your task is to use this information to do some related computations that help us understand the behavior of the series and its partial sums.     
            </p>

            <p>
                First, by computing the differences between <m>S_n</m> and <m>S</m> for several different 
                values of <m>n</m> (recalling that <m>S = \frac{5}{9} = 0.\overline{5}</m>), fill in the 
                first column of blank spaces provided below.  Then, by viewing the series 
                <me>S = 1 - \frac{4}{5} + \frac{16}{25} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^{n-1} + \cdots</me> 
                as being in the form 
                <me>S = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots</me>, fill in the last column of blank spaces.
            </p>
            <instruction>Enter your answer in decimal form, using at least 4 digits after the decimal point if applicable.</instruction>
